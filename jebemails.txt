Subject: Maggie Roger's concern for Jay Leonard from Crawfordville,Fl


I am very concerned about a situation that I think is out of control.   Jay Leonard is a young man who is paralyzed from the waist down.He has two small children and he supports his family.  He is not on welfare.  He went to  school and learned to use the cad program and he does drafting.   He has worked with several architects but since it is so hard for him to get around, he works in his own space rather than their office.  He puts on paper what people tell him to.  I have watched him first hand and I know this is what he does.  He does not do the design, he doesn't do the engineering, he simply does the drafting and then it is checked by the architect and if it needs it, the architect seals it.   Now it seems an architect in Crawfordville has decided to charge Jay Leonard with practicing as an architect.  He filed a charge in DBPR and the case  number is 2001-09523.  Jay Leonard barely makes it in life, but he does survive.  I think this insensitive attack on him from an irate architect is  so unfair.  Is there anything that can be done to help this young man.  He hasn't even answered the charges yet and I am so concerned for his welfare and the welfare of his wife and children.  If you have someone who can help, Jay Leonard's phone number is  850 926 2821 .  Can you let me know if you can help.  Thank you so much.  I am sorry to miss your inauguration.  I missed the last one too.  Glad you had a nice family ship trip.   God Bless   Maggie Rogers 407 599 0260

Subject:	The Bill to Stop Airport Licensing

Governor Bush;
I have been informed that there’s a bill pending that would stop the licensing by DOT of private airports in Florida.
I am a pilot, operate a Cessna Skylane and have one of those private airports.
I feel that this bill, if implemented, would not be in the best interests of any or all of the parties affected.
Many thanks for the ability to communicate with you in this fashion.

Subject: CEPRI Study




Governor:

Happy New Year!  I am glad to know that you are using your office on
campus more frequently, and I want to remind you that the kitchen in the

presidential home is always open if you are in the mood for a good
lunch--or snack--a few steps away.

The last time we spoke you asked about the CEPRI Equity Study.  Since
that time, the study has been published.  Based on the data that they
collected, CEPRI calculated a "funding per FTE (full-time equivalent)
student" figure for each of the state public universities which
generally validates our own findings.  These are the CEPRI per FTE data:





University of Florida:--------------------$15,858
University of South Florida:--------------$13,436
Florida State University:-----------------$11,409
Florida International University:----------$10,207

Group Average:-------------------------$12,728


These are the four public institutions in our system which are
classified as Carnegie Research Extensive (or Research I.)  The average
for this group, again, using the CEPRI numbers is $12,728 per FTE
student.  FIU comes out $2,521 below the average of the group for each
of the 21,800 FTE equivalent students that we serve, or a total of $52
million per year BELOW the average of our sister RI institutions.  The
CEPRI data confirm our point that --compared to our peers--FIU is
grossly under-funded.  By the way UCF, a virtual RI, fares even worse.
Also, CEPRI uses 1999-2000 data.  The current numbers make the disparity

even greater.

I want to be very careful not to mislead you in any way regarding this
finding.  The conclusion that I have drawn here is not what the CEPRI
study concluded, even though I am using their precise figures to prove
my point.  As the saying goes, "Figures lie and liars figure."  No one
is lying about the funding per FTE student, but what CEPRI did was to
group the institutions, not by their Carnegie research classifications
as I have done, but rather, by their SREB (Southern Regional Education
Board) classifications (sounds like an NCAA conference!)  In doing that,

CEPRI did not compare FIU to our true Carnegie peers.  I believe that
using a regional association classification over the national Carnegie
Foundation is inappropriate.

Thanks for your continued support.  I look forward to having the
opportunity to discuss these points with you in person.

Sincerely,


Mitch Maidique

Happy New year, first of all....

I know you read the e-mail from my husband Bob a few weeks ago...That trial was a nightmare.

Everyone involved,DCF,Judge,Legal Aid, Guardian Ad Lidem,all agreed that the Baby will stay with us.  But DCF said they want to terminate the mother's rights.....Governor Bush, she already surrendered her rights to the Baby on November 25th.  The Judge asked her attorney if she was in sound state of mind, she agreed.....

DCF had an attorney (since then has resigned form the department) who demanded on DCF terminating the Mothers rights and they would place the baby with us.....Egos...................

We have the next trial date this Monday January 6th, Judge Moses Baker is the presiding Judge.....DCF NEEDS TO BACK OFF.   Everyone agrees (even the Judge) that their is NO reason why we cannot have this a private adoption.

Here's the best part.  At the TPR trial for the Father on September 5th, 2002, the Judge said he would sign off.  Then, per your help, I received a letter from David May indicating that the Judge has the TPR papers in the works....Governor Bush, he NEVER SIGNED THE ORDER AND NOW, MISPLACE THE PAPERS.

We had our attorney Fed Ex the paperwork to the Father in Prison,he has signed the papers and sent them back to our attorney...he will be on the telephone in prison on Monday, to swear that he signed the papers and that he does NOT want the baby....This is ridiculous....I will bill DCF for the money that I have now spent on the attorney to do this.

Governor Bush, NOW I DESPERATELY NEED YOUR HELP.....STOP DCF. The  Judge keeps overruling DCF's request, but what if he does not on Monday.

Here is the last part. After we took the MAPP training class,we started the process to have a home study done...(June) IT IS STILL NOT DONE....It is sitting on the supervisors desk for three weeks.....We NEED IT ON MONDAY to show the Judge we are approved and ready to go!   Children's Home Society is so slow and unorganized.  They need help.................

Please get DCF off of our and everyone's back....Isn't the fact that the baby is in the perfect home,and DCF and everyone is thrilled about it, enough? they did their jobs..Don't they have enough kids in the system now? One happy ending would be nice....

Please help us now....

Thank you in advance.

COMMENT: I think you need to take another cruise to somewhere, anywhere and make it a one-way trip.
=============================================================
DCF Placed Children In Care Of Ex-Convicts
The Associated Press 
Published: Jan 1, 2003
   
MIAMI - The state has placed foster children in the homes of convicted felons, including former drug dealers and armed robbers, according to a newspaper report Tuesday. One Miami man convicted of child endangerment in New York for allegedly raping a child pleaded guilty later to raping a foster child in his care in Florida, according to an investigation by The Miami Herald. 

Another foster parent pleaded guilty to armed robbery for breaking into a man's apartment and holding him at gunpoint with her boyfriend in 1988. And a Jacksonville man who served 15 years in prison for heroin trafficking became a foster parent along with his wife in July. 



Felons Say Agency Aware Of Records 

Foster parents contacted by the newspaper said the Department of Children and Families knew about their past convictions but allowed them to care for foster children because they had paid for their crimes and reformed their behavior. 

``They know everything about me,'' said Leon Campbell, who was released from prison in 1991 after serving time for heroin trafficking. He now helps run his local church and is involved with a prison drug- rehabilitation program. 

``I showed them how my life has changed. Everything was done properly.'' 

State law disqualifies people who have been convicted of certain crimes from becoming foster parents, but not all felonies are included on the list of disqualifying offenses. 

Not included are welfare fraud, forgery and grand theft. 

The state also has discretion to consider how a person has reformed himself or herself in cases in which the applicant's criminal record is more than three years old. 

If the person is disqualified, he or she can appeal the decision. 

The Herald reported that the state placed foster children in the homes of 168 convicted felons in the last five years and received payments of $10 to $50 a day per child. 

There are about 5,000 foster homes in the state. 



Internal Investigation Under Way 

But DCF officials dispute the number of convicted felons serving as foster parents. 

``Our findings lead us to believe that there are some inaccuracies in the article,'' agency spokesman Bob Brooks said. 

``I don't believe the picture is as bad as it's made out to be.'' 

Brooks said he will know how many felons are foster parents next week, when the agency's internal investigation is complete. 

Some of the cases revealed by the Herald include: 

* Carlos Estrella, convicted of child endangerment for allegedly raping a child in New York in 1966. He became a Florida foster parent in 1995 and received payments from DCF until three days before his 1999 arrest for raping a child in his care. Estrella has since died. DCF is being sued in this case. 

* Mary Helen Walley, 52, was sentenced to two years in prison for selling crack cocaine to a Tampa police officer in 1990. She has six foster children. 

``If they didn't think I have what it takes to take care of these children, they wouldn't have given them to me,'' Walley said. 

* Ann Ruth Hodges, 33, was sentenced to three years' probation for a home-invasion robbery nearly 15 years ago. 

She pleaded guilty to armed robbery, armed burglary, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm during a felony. 

The Homestead woman has five foster children. 

``I don't have anything to hide,'' she said. ``I have those crimes in my background, and I'd rather not talk about it.''

Dear: Gov.Jeb

My name is Joe Robinson. I was appointed to the
Southwest Florida Water Management District(SWFWMD)
Northwest Hillsborough Basin Board by you in March 2001.
As of today I have become aware of a possible opening 
that may occur due to Pam Iorio Supervisor of Elections 
stepping down to run for Mayor of Tampa. If such will be 
the case please consider me as a qualified candidate for the appointment.
 
My term on the (SWFWMD)Northwest Hillsborough Basin Board expires in
March 2003. I have recently run for the Supervisor of Elections office
and obtained 35% of the votes (115,680) in 2000. I had recently started
my campaign for Tampa City Council District 3 (Citywide) when this opportunity
presented itself. A copy of the article in the Tampa Tribune Dated
January 1, 2003 is attached as a file. In addition, I have also
attached a recent questionnaire dated December 31,2002 that was turned
into the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce for your review and use.

Finally, let me say thank you again and hopefully maybe I can compete
to be the first Afro-American(Black) Constitutional Officer that Hillsborough
County has ever had as a Republican and Qualified.

Mrs.Iorio is having a press conference on Monday January 6,2003
to make her announcement one way or the other.  

If you have any questions or comments please contact me. 

Respectfully yours,

I just wanted to let you know that three of your Statewide Advocacy Council members, three Local Advocacy Council members and  our Tallahassee staff (Bill Marvin and Regenia Murray) will be attending the Inauguration ceremonies in Tallahassee.  We are looking forward to seeing you sworn in and to working with you to make Florida a better place for individuals with unique needs.  While in Tallahassee, we also have plans to participate with Secretary Regier in an effort to improve the DCF/DD program and to present an award to one of your outstanding staff members.   Incidentally, speaking of staff, I want you to know that Kristen and Emily have been extremely helpful in arranging plans and getting tickets for the Inauguration ceremonies.  I also want you to know that we have been pleased that you assigned Laura Branker of your staff to work with us; she has been very helpful and responsive.
Thank you, and see you soon,

Dear Governor Bush,

 

CNN Money printed the following on New Years Day, for which I must comment on.

 

First off, my company does offer a 401K plan for employees. I have wanted to do this

for several years, but it has proved to be impossible. When it takes every penny you earn to survive, you just cannot save money. 

When taxes eat up every spare dime you could have used for the support of your family, and you hear some stupid politician say 

something about raising taxes, you just want to scream in his ear! 

 

As far as credit cards go, people  like myself do not qualify for credit cards...key word is CREDIT, for which you do not have 

when your broke. Even those who qualify with some credit card institution that do not have the means to repay easily find 

themselves destroyed by bad credit.

 

Get a new job? Many of us have had to already because of companies going belly up or cutting back, some people 

haven't been so lucky to find another job, or they have had to accept lower paying jobs just to cover the bare necessities. 

I personally haven't had a raise now for 3 years, I have had major increases in health care payments, and I have seen 

my company bonus plan dwindle to a $12.00 Christmas bonus because of the slow down in the economy. 

 

Build an estate plan? Save more? Eat out less? Smell the roses?

Well of these, my wife and I get 1 meal out a year on our wedding anniversary...

Which we just observed our 22nd on December 27th at the local Cracker Barrel Restaurant

(the bill came to almost $20.00, and I left a $2.00 tip to the waitress) 

because we just cannot afford these luxuries, much less be able to smell the roses! 

 

I watched my wife cry at Christmas with her mother because we had no money for Christmas gifts. 

That is very painful to the inner soul. But we all have our love for each other, and the

Love for God and country. My wife does has a prospect for new employment, for which she

Will know the answer to in the next couple of weeks, and hopefully she will be hired. 

It is a $6.50 an hour job, and it will greatly help our current condition. She was laid off 

In October 2002 because of the mismanagement at the school where she worked. 

 

By the way, I have lost about 5 lbs of body weight this past year. I am of small body-size already, 

and I don't have any body fat to lose so the "exercise more" statement really is not something I need 

to do any way...in fact I have to conserve energy because I have not been able to afford to eat right lately.

 

I do have an appointment on Thursday morning with someone at our bank to help figure out our financial position. 

At this point, we are looking at falling back and punting as an option but not a desired direction...but more 

concessions will have to be made at this families home before a way out of debt will come.

 

God has provided for my family for 22 years now because of hard work, faith, and 

the sacrifices we have made as a family. I have nothing to be ashamed of about 

the way we live. I am a hard and honest worker, and so is my wife. 

 

Take care Governor Bush. 

Think of families like mine, and pass the word around

about families like ours when ever you get a chance!

 

Bryan Siddell

Subject:	Re: Information from NPAE and Whom ever this may concern.

Greetings!

Ms. Chambers:

My request for policy that would govern Neighborhood Enhancement District,
Councils, is no more than due process, to secure to the Black citizens (I do
not see County Commissioner Josephus Eggelletion, Jr. forcing this program
in the City of Lauderdale Lakes where he is a resident or in the majority
White Communities that are in his District, Being that his record in
Tallahassee as a State Rep for approx. 8 years show little or no Legislation
that protect the Black Community. Oh yeah! Eggelletion did vote for building
more jails, for who? and he voted to protect us from God by not voting for
prayer in school as a State Rep.) of Black communities that were forced (By
County Staff, Handpick Negro's from the Communities and at least one County
Commissioner, who only claim to fame is this bill for Blacks) into having
the so-called Neighborhood Enhancement Districts protection against abuses,
encroachments, taxation w/o representation, conflict of interest, Just and
Equitable Taxation, Proper Use of Public Property (Gentrification) and Full
Disclosure of Public Records and Proceedings.

It concerns me that the County Administrator, and the County Attorney would
allow County Staff to present a program of this magnitude, to the County
Commissioners for their endorsement and approval, with out checks and
balances or having accountability (Oh yeah! Its for the Black Community,
NBA, it does not matter.).

The fact that County Staff seem to have been relentless in their efforts to
extend time and time again, to vested interest groups and at least one
County Commissioner, to impose this program on Black Communities raises some
serious concerns of conflict of interest and many questions.

How many County Commissioners have no choice but, to support these programs,
because they may be directly or indirectly a part of Political Corruption,
Conflict of Interest, Improper Use of Public Property, Providing Inside
County Information to various Individuals, Groups, friends and or relatives.
In some cases ensuring contracts that if, they did not do as the County
Commissioner(s) said do, that the Contractor can rest assure that they would
not receive any work in their District (The people District)? What
Homeowners Presidents and officers have received monies as a result of being
the Homeowners Association President or the Neighborhood Enhancement
District, Presidents and officers received pay, favor and or other royalties
as a result of their status? What Contractors would come forward and reveal
the Commissioner(s) involved in this type od corruption? Will some of the
Democratic County Commissioners use their political connection with the
Republican Governor, to cover some of this magnitude up? Your guest is as
good as any. I am sure this e-mail will call for County Cover-up time.

One can believe that County government can benefit from programs such as the
Neighborhood Enhancement, District by pushing aggressive code and zoning, to
justify gentrification, and later blaming untrained, unqualfield, uneducated
and unpolitical aware folk for the abuse and unlawful acts. Where will
Commissioner Eggelletion be when this happens? Why would the Commissioner
allow the program to be in place without safe guards? Oh yeah! He is a
"Consultant".

Word to the wise, to County Employees and citizens. The County Whistle
Blower Program, is a lot worst than the County Equal Opportunity Office.

The County Administrator was commended for his efforts in the Constitutional
Office of the Supervisor of Election attack. Well as the sound goes, Who was
making Love, to your Old Lady, While you was out making love. In other words
County Staff has its own problems and we do not see anyone calling in the
Governor. Will the County Commission allow or call for an Federal audit on
the County's Administrative practice with in County Government? I dare them.

This is why our communities need policy to protect us, because the County is
the only local government we have and we no longer trust you guys. Sure you
can find some idiot to challenge our concern, but I assure you that person
is not informed or has a vested interest.

N.A.A.C.P. You are not doing anything. don't get caught covering up for the
County as it has already been suggested. Bill, do you remember the last two
article that the County Administrator implicated you as. To you and your
Staff, if you cannot be apart of the solution, I suggest you not be a part
of the problem. I did not know, I am new at this, and I am sorry (It may be
true) but, it does not handle well in the Black Community. This is a New
Year, anything goes.

What procedure is available to "demolish" the Washington Park Neighborhood

Mr. Major has asked:

What are the rules for removing an officeholder from the Washington Park

I will refer both of these questions to the County Attorney for an opinion.

Hello Mr. Major,

Thanks for clarifying Ms. Tillman-Watson's concern.  As I understand the
question, Ms. Tillman-Watson wants to know the process for removal of a
Neighborhood Council member.  Based on my reading, subsection163.524 of
the Florida Statutes does not provide a process for removal.  However,
there may be general procedures in the statutes which apply, of which I
am unaware.

I will request the County Attorney to provide a response to your
question regarding removal of a member from a neighborhood council.  I
will forward the response to you as soon as possible.

Hi Ms Chambers:

Happy Holidays to you and yours.

Ms. Chambers, I do not believe Ms. Tillman-Watson have you guys
attention. It is my understanding that the Washington Park Community
have three forces to work with: 1.) The Washington Park Homeowners
Association, the 2.)Lafayette Hart Park Association and 3.) the
Neighborhood Preservation and Enhancement Plan (The N.P.E.P.). The
County assured Ms. Tillman- Watson equal inclusion of all governmental
process, as the county do for the other two entities of the Washington
Park Community. I do not think that She is looking for special
treatment, but equal treatment.

The County have empowered the Washington Park Homeowners Association to
operate as two entices which may be a conflict of interest. However, the
Neighborhood Preservation and Enhancement Plan is County Government
driven and should comply with the same laws, rules, regulation and
procedures that the County is accountable to up-hold.

The N.P.E.P. is responsible for providing their resident with
information in a reasonable time (Generally, Ten Working days), Full
disclosure of Public Records and Proceedings, fair and equal
distribution of all government funding, and inclusion in the decision
making process of the Community.

The County should no longer cover up for those folk that are not
complying with the law or sound governmental practices.We can not be
responsible for folk incompetence, yet, wanting to be in charge of
something.

 The Coalition is requesting that the County provide residents with
laws, policy and other tools to remove folk from the various positions
of the Neighborhood Preservation and Enhancement Program that violate
voters, citizens,and taxpayer Rights. Otherwise, you guys can be
misconstrued as showing favor or causing serious problems in the Black
Community, purposely or otherwise.

Please provide the Coalition with policy or procedures that govern these
programs and the tools that the residents have available to them, which
will remove folk from these positions for not complying with their
obligations.

Thank you.

Estimado Governador Bush:
 
Primeramente, Feliz Año Nuevo para usted y su familia.
 
No sé si se acuerda de mi e-mail anterior con respecto a mi hija, Estrella María.  Nosotros habiamos aplicado para 'Clemency' y usted refirió su caso a Wendy.  El pasado 24 de diciembre recibí correspondencia de Janet Kees informandome que no podemos aplicar para un waiver de Clemency porque mi hija no lleva 2 años presa...La fecha que ella fue sentenciada y encarcelada definitivamente fué el 19 de julio, pero ella ya había cumplido 3 meses anteriores en 'County'.  Aunque entiendo la ley, no le veo la lógica.  Toda persona encarcelada tiene que cumplir 2 años de prisión antes de poder aplicar para 'Clemency' y despues el proceso se demora entre 6 a 12 meses... No parece que ustedes quieren que los presos tengan ninguna esperanza en poder salir antes de tiempo....Comprendo esto para presos VIOLENTOS O ASESINOS, pero me parece injusto que para una persona no violenta esta ley se aplique.  De todas formas yo guardaré todo el archivo que preparé y lo volveré a enviar en julio/2003.
 
Muchas gracias por su atención y nuevamente muchas felicidades .
 
Go Hurricanes!

                                                                                                                                                               January 3, 2003


Dear Governor Bush:

     I have written to your family in the past, expressing my views on what a proud time in my life it was to serve under your Father during the Gulf War, I have written to your Brother sending him and his administration praise on what a tremendous job he is doing as President, and I have written you, Governor Bush, trying to put into words just how overjoyed I am with the job that you are doing as my state's Governor... Apparently, I'm not the only Floridian that's happy with your work, as the last election will reflect.

     This time, I'm writing on behalf of my brother-in-law. He is a Colombian National that has worked hard in this country for many years. 

     In April 1995 my wife ( A Naturalized U.S. Citizen, and a proud Republican) and I (also a proud member of the Republican Party) petitioned for him to be granted permanent Residency, a green card.

     All has been going well, as he was issued an Employment Authorization Document, and has worked hard ever since, but the problem is that the process in dealing with the INS is a long and difficult one. There are situations that occur that are hindered by his lack of a Green Card, For example... His son is incredibly intelligent, and at the age of 16 has been accepted to Rutgers University, an honor and opportunity that my never come again. However, admittance into the college requires showing documentation of Legal Residency.

     I am well aware of the terrorist threats that we now deal with on a daily basis, I am also fully cognizant of the fact that any alien could constitute a possible threat to our citizens and our way of life. For these reasons the INS is being extra cautious of allowing aliens to permanently reside in the U.S. But, let me assure you, Sir, that my Brother-In Law is, without a doubt, the most honest, hardworking taxpayer that I have ever had the pleasure to know. He loves this nation, and will always be true to it's cause. He wants only to have the ability to make a better life for his family by earning his green card and eventually becoming a U.S. Citizen. These are dreams he has had for a long, long time.

     I consider myself to be an honorable person. I have served for 14 years in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, I have been awarded many high honors by the Department of the Army, I am currently a Deputy Sheriff with the Broward Sheriff's Office and I think of myself as a good judge of character ... with these things in mind, I can tell you straight out that I will do anything necessary to sponsor him or give him the highest recommendation possible to complete this petition for residency. He will make a fine citizen and a great American, if given the chance. 

     Mr. Governor, may I respectfully request that your office look into the status of his petition for Residency. He and his family have waited patiently for a long time and few answers are coming out of the INS office in Miami.

     His name is Victor I. Alfonso, Applicant   A74  702  700, he currently resides in Sunrise, Florida.

     Governor Bush, anything that your office can do will be greatly appreciated by me and my entire family. If you have any questions regarding this email please don't hesitate to ask.

Thank you, Sir for your time and efforts in this matter, and thank you, too, for doing such a splendid job of running this Great State.

     Respectfully,

Subject: Request from a loyal Hillsborough County Republican


January 2, 2003

 

 

Dear Jeb:

 

I'm writing for several reasons. As you probably have heard there has been untrue and unnecessary media coverage of recent events involving the Hillsborough County Republican Executive Committee elections. I have attached the articles, as well as my emails to their author, Laura Kinsler. In my opinion, the instigator of these articles, Al Higginbotham, Jr., is an embarrassment to the party. He has distorted the truth for his own gain and is attempting to create a deep rift between Republicans in Hillsborough County. He repeatedly uses his role in your re-election campaign to legitimize his activities. As someone who has personally had private comments repeated and taken out of context in the press, I'm sure you can appreciate how detrimental Mr. Higginbotham's behavior is to our party.

 

It might be helpful for someone from your office to have a chat with Mr. Higginbotham and his cohort Eric Brown. If they are truly loyal Republicans, they need to understand that internal party differences should be handled within the party, not in the media. The "Field Hand" comment, which was featured in one of the attached articles, is now the topic for next week's "Speak Up" column in the Tribune Metro section. Enough is enough.

 

Today's Tampa Tribune also contains an article identifying possible successors to Pam Iorio, Supervisor of Elections, should she choose to run for mayor. Mr. Higginbotham has expressed interest in this appointment. I do not believe that someone who puts his own interests above the good of the party deserves to be rewarded. Please do not consider him for this highly visible, important role.

 

I believe this appointment should go to a loyal, hard-working party member. I think Janet Kovach would make an excellent Supervisor of Elections and I am asking you to give her serious consideration for the post. I know she has served under your leadership in the past and I believe she is someone you can trust to handle the significant responsibilities of this position. 

 

Thank you in advance for your consideration. I wish you the best of luck as you embark on your historic second term and in any future endeavors. I am proud to have campaigned for you and will be happy to assist you in any way I can during the next four years.

 

Regards,

Dear Governor,
 
    I know that you do not have a lot of time to read lengthy emails, however, I thought this might interest you. As the Executive Director of the Ruskin Chamber I am given a column in the local newspaper. Over the past two weeks and for next week I have been writing a column on divorce and the family. I am calling the series "Renew the Family Tree in 2003".
 
I have included these three columns below I hope you have the opportunity to read them and if you would like, you could use the tagline of "Renew the Family Tree in 2003"
 
Sincerely,

Chamber Notes, The Ruskin Chamber of Commerce
By: Daniel Kushmer
 
December 26, 2002, Column
 
The Office of Vital Statistics reports in 2001 there were 153,298 marriages with 85,259 divorces. Specifically, in Hillsborough County 9,581 marriages took place with 5,472 divorces. The dissolution of marriage rate increased in 2001 to 5.2 per 1,000 population. And, the marriage rate has steadily decreased since 1997 from 10.6 per 1,000 in 1997 to 9.3 per 1,000 in 2001.

 

Over the next few columns, I would like to take the opportunity to discuss ways we can bring the family back together. Divorce and the breakdown of the family unit is a strain on the economy in so many ways. And, as a chamber we must look at all aspects that affect the business climate. We all know that divorce usually causes an economic hardship, usually affecting children as well. The lose of homes, jobs and standard of living is all too common.

 

Again, back to the Office of Vital Statistics. Out of the 85,259 divorces in 2001 at least 34,483 of these divorces affected children. In today's world, businesses compete for an ever stretching dollar and when the family is pulled apart so to the dollars. Today's mobile society has lost sight of the family unit and the role the extended family plays. Grandma, Grandpa, brother's & sister's, and aunt's & uncle's are vital to a healthy family. When that is removed by relocation the core family must work harder to stay healthy and united. So many factors play a role in the divorce rate and reduction in marriage. I will not say I know all of them, however, in the new millenium society seems to discourage the sanctity of marriage.

 

Movies, television, radio, print media, and advertising have all contributed. Watch your favorite show, read your favorite magazine, or listen to your favorite radio program and in just a few short minutes you will be able to see the glorification of being single and living a selfish life. How many single parents do you know? How many of these moms and dads do not have support from the other parent? This is truly the tragedy. We bring children into this world and then expect them to grow up and be good citizens, yet we are not equipping them to achieve this expectation.

 

A group of Clergy in Jacksonville, Florida has said "What God has joined together, let the Church help hold together". This is relevant since more than 75% of all marriages are performed by clergy. Government involvement in marriage is not the answer; however, making it a little more difficult to get a divorce without making it more lucrative for attorneys can't hurt. 

 

Families need help and next week I will discuss further how I think we can work together to bring the family back together. Please stay tuned and if you have any comments, please do not hesitate to write me at  <mailto:ruskinchamber@earthlink.net> ruskinchamber@earthlink.net.

 
January 2, 2003 Column
 

Happy New Year! I hope all the citizens of SouthShore had a wonderful Christmas. Last week I began a series addressing the tragedy of divorce and the breakdown of the family unit. I alluded to the church and the fact that the clergy perform over 75% of all marriages. This week I would like to elaborate on this fact. "What God has joined together, let the Church help hold together", but first.

 

To further illustrate how divorce affects children, lets look at a few statistics. Children whose parents are divorced have higher rates of delinquency and substance abuse. Children raised in an environment of conflict also appear to be at risk for defiance, academic failure, immaturity, disrespect, peer conflicts, and poor self-control. In understanding the unique role a mother and father play in raising children, parents can develop a deeper, more meaningful, parent/child relationship. Husbands and wives who develop effective communication patterns will be better equipped to deal with conflict and the challenges of raising children.

 

Understanding the economic hardship a divorce places on a family and the potential long-term consequences placed on children you can see why is important the business community should be concerned. Companies throughout the country need consumers. They also need a steady source of educated employees. Divorce can and usually does disrupt both of these needs for business to prosper.

 

Since most Americans need to be prepared to up-root and relocate the family to follow employment, the extended family is less involved. This part of our families' relationship is vital for a healthy marriage, so, how do we bring this back to the family? I believe the church can and should play a major role. The church family can be a healthy alternative to the extended family, especially when none exist. The leaders and lay leaders of the church can bring families together with other families that share commonalties.

 

Before taking any legal steps to end a marriage, couples should make sure that they have tried all possible ways to save it. Many communities and social and religious organizations offer counseling services either free or on a sliding scale. The church has vast resources and programs that are designed to help families stay together. Also, the church membership is a diverse network of individuals knowledgeable in many areas. From programs designed to provide education for new marriages to support and assistance to single parents and many aspects in between the church can be your one stop source.

 

It's a new-year with many possibilities, hopes, and dreams. Let's make this year, the year we "Renew the Family Tree in 2003". More on "Renew" next week. As always, your comments are welcomed and you can reach me at  <mailto:ruskinchamber@earthlink.net> ruskinchamber@earthlink.net.

 

January 9, 2003 Column

 
When you make a serious commitment to another person, you open up the possibility of happiness for yourself. However, if your not getting the love you want from the person you're with, you need to do something about it. You need to communicate with greater accuracy and sensitivity, understanding how to let go of the self-defeating behaviors, and focus your energy on meeting your partner's needs. If an open and honest line of communication is established the downward spiral of the power struggle is transformed into a mutually beneficial process of spiritual and emotional growth.

 

Understanding the differences between men and women is the first step. We are different and as such, we have different needs and wants. Many times this is the only reason given for divorce, "we just don't see eye to eye, were too different". Well yea! You are different and you need to know this from the start. As written in previous columns, divorce is usually an economic and social disaster affecting more than just the husband and wife. Children become pawns in the process. As a society, we need to help reduce the divorce rate and bring back economic stability to the family, the life-blood of this country.

 

"Renew the Family Tree in 2003". The American Heritage Dictionary describes Family Tree as a Noun and, 1.A genealogical diagram of a family's ancestry. 2.The ancestors and descendants of a family considered as a group. A family is a group, a group of individuals all with different ideas, desires, needs and wants. And, if understanding this and capitalizing on the differences a family can become very successful.

 

Throughout the years we have heard of various ways to bring the family together. Family night, Family game night, Dinner's together, and many other activities all have a purpose. Bringing us together. We do live in a very mobile society and with an ever-increasing tax burden; many of us work twice as hard as we did not too many years ago, just to pay taxes. What are your priorities? Just bringing home the bacon or, bringing home the bacon and helping the family fry it up. Quality time does always have to mean quantity; however, quality time does require your time.

 

I would like to add one more to the various ways you can bring your family together. The Family Tree. What better way to understand your family heritage and help you and your children understand why you think as you do. You can trace your family tree in many ways, the library is a great reference and of course, the Internet can give you real-time history. One website in particular is a great resource. Ancestory.com is good place to start to "Renew your Family Tree in 2003". Of course, this is just an exercise that can give you a lot of enjoyment. The real purpose is to bring your family together.

 

If you have a church home, go see the lay leader or pastor and find out what kind of resources are available that can help you and your family, stay together. I believe the church has a moral obligation to society to help the American Family and does just that. If you do not have a church home, find one. The communities in SouthShore are blessed with many churches for all walks of life and faith, use these resources. It is my desire to see the American Family stay together and prosper, not only is it good for business, it's good for America. As always, your comments are welcomed and you can reach me at ruskinchamber@earthlink.net.

Governor Bush,
Please tell me this isn't true.  Can we go to
any other country and pull the wool over their
eyes.  When we become weak and give into
these requests by individuals, it only encour
ages others to see if they can break our rules
and that isn't good.  We must not give in to
anything that breaks down our system and this
could be a start.  How does a police officer 
identify this person by their drivers license?
When I go to the bank as an AMERICAN
citizen to cash a check I have to show my
drivers license so that they can see that I am
the person who owns that account. How can
a teller tell that from just seeing the eyes?
They all have dark hair and black eyes. 
We must not go backwards.  We must not give
in.  We must tell our reasons for denying this
person her request.  
Respectfully,

Subject: DCF troubles continue for Maria Moya.From Elaine Adler


Hi Jeb,
 
This DCF mess with my secretary, Maria Moya, continues to worsen.  Maria's DCF social worker, Olive Walker,  had requested that Maria's visitations  and her parents were to be eliminated because "they were rough with the baby"  and "the baby shows fear with them".  That is not true, as evidenced by the two reports  that DCF made stating that "mother is appropriate" and "baby shows  no fear".   Robert Boyack, who is Olive's superior, said to Maria that she is not being heard, and said he is going to look into the case.  I'm sure that's your
doing, and we thank you for that.
 
Just now,  Maria's attorney said that in the motion that Olive filed, they are going to file for child support and supposedly told them she wasn't working.  That is another lie being perpetrated by Olive because she has repeatedly called Maria here at work.
 
This whole matter smacks of a combination of incompetence and favoritism towards the father, a known domestic violence abuser.    There is a really serious problem here .  
 
Maria's attorney, a public defender, says this is all being done to try to terminate Maria's parental rights.  The baby's father,
Joel Balmaceda, has always said to Maria that "he will do anything to take the baby away" since Maria separated from him after he beat her up.    I think Joel has influenced Olive to the point where she is either afraid or incapable of making an
independent decision.
 
What now?

Great to see you in Delray Beach to honor our "Homefront Security" volunteers.
I hope Mayor Guiliani also enjoyed his visit.  Thank you both for taking time.

I know you seemed surprised when you realized I was an elected Delray Beach
City Commissioner.  I'm just now finishing my first two year term!  It has been great.

My other current claim to fame is as a Delray Commissioner I sit (with the Boynton
Beach City Commission) on our shared Sewage Treatement Plant board.  In fact
my Mom is so proud as I was elected Chairman of that Board.  Ugh!

Anyway, our Treatment plant is embarking on a project to convert our facility to 100%
reuse quality capacity.  This will allow for us to replace existing potable water 
irrigation demands on the aquifer with our reclaimed supply.  Currently we provide
around 20% of our discharge as reuse quality which is delivered to several of the golf course
communities for their irrigation needs, thus reducing the draw on groundwater supplies.

In order to accomplish this we are applying for $6mm in Federal Grant Funding.  I 
would very much appreciate if you would consider writing a letter
of support to accompany our Grant Application.  I have attached a copy of a sample
letter which provides additional information to you on the project.

Thanks in advance for your consideration.  Lori joins me in wishing you and
your family a great 2003!  As always, let me know if you need additional information.

Best,
Jon

Dear Governor Jeb,

Hope your Christmas cruise went well.  I thank God that we have a governor 
that is really down to earth and not stuck in an ivory tower.  I really 
appreciate all that you tried to do for me regarding the beach restoration 
situation in Brevard County involving the Villager Condominiums in 
Indialantic.

Now we are in a new crisis.  My husband and I own 2 pizza restaurants called 
Brooklyn Pizza.  My husband has been in business for himself  since 1984.  He 
is a real Mom and Pop type of operation.  Since he uses real quality food we 
do not make the profits that the chains do.

Our dilemma is this.  We are having trouble getting workman's comp insurance. 
 All of the sudden they are refusing to insure us.  It feels like extortion 
taking our premiums and once their is a claim you lose your right to get it.  
My husband has had a clean record and only until this year did he have an 
employee hurt in a car accident in which he was not at fault.  We do not hire 
teenagers.  Our drivers must have PIP insurance to work with us and cannot 
work for us if they get a speeding ticket.  Most of our drivers are in their 
30's.  They have good driving records and we do weekly checks on them through 
the DMV.  

If we cannot find a company that will sell us the insurance at a reasonable 
rate we are out of business.  We opened our second Brooklyn Pizza just a year 
ago.  One's in Orlando and the other in Winter Park.  We are told that we 
will have to go through the state which will cost us about $50,000 a year.  
Our overhead is so high this will put us out of business along with about 20 
employees then will have to go on unemployment.  We have until Jan. 12th to 
find cheaper insurance and no one has been able to help us so far.

I pray that you have some good news or advice for us.  Business has been down 
since 911 and we are hanging on as we have kids that want to go to college.  
Please feel free to call my husband directly or myself.  Again thank you for 
all you've done for our state.  Have a blessed New Year and Noelle is in our 
prayers.

Sincerely,
Andrea Gagliano

Dear Governor:

As Chairman Emeritus of the University of Tampa and my ongoing interest and
concern for them, as well as all of the independent colleges and
universities of Florida, I am writing to you.

I recognize that you are about to "release" the 2003-2004 budget and I ask
that you consider:

	a)	Funding the Florida Resident Access Grant (FRAG) at $3,000,
including funding the FRAG enrollment growth.  As you know, the modest
additional investment will actually save taxpayer money and utilize our
quality accredited private institutions to reduce the burden of more costly
funding in public higher education.

	b)	If it is not at all possible to increase the size of the per
student FRAG, then I hope that at least we include in the proposed budget
additional funds to pay for enrollment growth.  Of course, if the enrollment

Dear Governor Bush:

Happy New Year. 

A lot has happened since I spoke to you last at the Family Care Counsel. On April 15th, 2002 I suffered a medically induced heart attack because the BCBS approved Physician I went to the day before patted me on the head and said, "Everybody suffers Indigestion sometimes." The next day, in total frustration, I went to my former doctor and in less then five minutes I was in the Critical Cardiac Unit. The approved BCBS Physician had administered about four times as much medication as needed. 

Last October I found out that my heart is fine now but to keep it that way I need a better wheelchair, namely one with automatic elevating leg-rests and reclining. After much searching and lots of measuring the permobil was selected to be the best. Two physicians and one physical therapist wrote up all the needed paperwork and we spent hours explaining the need to the medical review team. 

BCBS came back with the finding that they would pay for the base of the chair, the batteries, the armrests but not the seat or the leg-rests. The DME provider and I argued for hours that it makes no sense to approve 4 wheels and a motor without the seat. That's a bit like buying a car with no steering device. 

Thinking that they may have mistaken the term "base of the chair" as "basic chair" we sent them a picture of their approved parts, to no avail.

I am still a Medicaid Waiver Provider and working full-time but unless I am allowed to have a workable wheelchair that allows me to remain pain free I may not be able to continue.

This is only the latest debacle with BCBS. Can your office assist with this problem? 

I look forward to hearing from you again.

Jeb: During this past year my wife, Suzy, switched her medical practice from internal medicine to a specialty in the field of morbid obesity. As a result of her new practice I have become inundated with information from her about the health problems that afflict Americans due to bad diets and lack of exercise. I am not aware (and it maybe as a result of my ignorance) what, if any, initiatives emanate from the Governor's Office or even the federal government directly to educate and motivate Americans to eat better and exercise more. It seems to me that not only could our government educate the public about this but that our leaders could use their pulpits to motivate and encourage by communicating with them directly (or even by example) , as opposed to a a government health bureaucracy sending bulletins to the medical profession. If  Americans were do take better care of themselves it not only would improve the quality of their lives but it also would reduce unnecessary medical expenses, such as Medicare and Medicaid costs, brought about due to avoidable health problems.
 
I am passing this on to you as I know that you like public policy initiatives that directly help the people. It may be that you already have something like this, in which event, I regret my ignorance and apologize for taking your time.
 
Happy New Year!

Dear Governor Bush:

Happy New Year. 

A lot has happened since I spoke to you last at the Family Care Counsel. On
April 15th, 2002 I suffered a medically induced heart attack because the
BCBS approved Physician I went to the day before patted me on the head and
said, "Everybody suffers Indigestion sometimes." The next day, in total
frustration, I went to my former doctor and in less then five minutes I was
in the Critical Cardiac Unit. The approved BCBS Physician had administered
about four times as much medication as needed. 

Last October I found out that my heart is fine now but to keep it that way I
need a better wheelchair, namely one with automatic elevating leg-rests and
reclining. After much searching and lots of measuring the permobil was
selected to be the best. Two physicians and one physical therapist wrote up
all the needed paperwork and we spent hours explaining the need to the
medical review team. 

BCBS came back with the finding that they would pay for the base of the
chair, the batteries, the armrests but not the seat or the leg-rests. The
DME provider and I argued for hours that it makes no sense to approve 4
wheels and a motor without the seat. That's a bit like buying a car with no
steering device. 

Thinking that they may have mistaken the term "base of the chair" as "basic
chair" we sent them a picture of their approved parts, to no avail.

I am still a Medicaid Waiver Provider and working full-time but unless I am
allowed to have a workable wheelchair that allows me to remain pain free I
may not be able to continue.

This is only the latest debacle with BCBS. Can your office assist with this
problem? 

I look forward to hearing from you again.

Hi Governor,
I hope New Year was good to you & your family. We are thinking seriously of leaving Fla, I will miss having you as a governor but can't accept the way things are done here. Poor Billy has been waiting for SS for over 2yrs now & reconsideration a year. They have totally ignored him even though their Dr put totally disabled. I'm also tired of being nailed to the cross for $180. a month & then hear from foster parents they get so much more inc food stamps, clothing allowance $ for xmas & I was told they would get big money for Billy since he's high risk. Us grandparents keep them out of the foster care system & get no help at all.
We have gone thru all our savings just raising him & getting him treatments that aren't covered. All they say is so make him a foster child which I would never do!
I know some of you have tried to help like Bob Graham but it seems like no use. I know if we were up north none of this would be happening.
Have a good New Year & lots of luck,
Joy Buchholz

Dear Governor,
 
My name is Jeff Lucas and I am an attorney from Pasco County.  I am a former Republican Executive Committee Chairman for Pasco County and  Currently  the President of the West Pasco Republican Club.  I work very hard for Republicans.  I have met you briefly at political events and proudly display a photo with you and my daughter Rachel in my home.
 
I know your time is incredibly valuable and that is why I have never written you in the past.  Nevertheless, I  feel obligated to write you today on behalf of  a good friend, a fellow Republican and an awesome Circuit Judge, Craig Villanti.  As you are aware, Judge Villanti is a candidate for the 2nd DCA Judicial vacancy.
 
In regard to political considerations, Judge Villanti is the only candidate for the 2nd DCA vacancy that is from Pasco County. In fact, a person from Pasco County has never sat on the 2nd DCA Court of Appeals.  Craig Villanti has always been a friend to the Republican Party and before becoming a Judge was active in the West Pasco Republican Club.
 
From a Judicial perspective,  Judge Villanti  has a proven track record of being a strict constructionist and will not legislate from the bench.  He is brilliant and has a photographic memory. I have personally argued hundreds of cases in front of Judge Villanti including numerous Jury trials.  Regardless of the situation he  treats attorneys, clients and courtroom personnel  with respect, fairness and consistency.  In the criminal division, Judge Villanti follows the sentencing guidelines.  In trial,  his knowledge of the rules of evidence eliminates mistakes and appeals.
 
Appointing Judge Craig Villanti to the 2nd DCA Court of Appeals is smart politically and great for the people of Florida.  A win win situation no matter how you analyze it.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  My entire family prays for your success.
 
 
Cordially,

Dear Gov. Jeb: 

more thoughts...I hear on the AM radio all the time that steel buildings are cheaper to build than others...could they be used for school construction? 

Although gambling in the state may not be a first desirable, some minimal types for the benefit of education would be allright I think and probably so with most Floridians.  And, maybe it could be structured with a State bond issue for school construction backed by taxes from the "one-armed bandits" so Florida investors could avoid the intangibles tax in case it ends up being with us longer than hoped.

Here's what they had to say:
Sir, when I moved to FL 4 years ago I sent you an e-mail about speeding on
I-95 and I-4, some of it by police officers themselves not in pursuit.
Isn't there something we can do to stop this senseless loss of life? FHP
should be providing more enforcement of the laws. There should be a HIGH
VISIBILITY campaign against speeding, showing some of the carnage that
happens. We used this sort of publicity in the military very effectively.
It would cause people to be more focused on the dangers of these careless
acts on our highways and city streets. Thank you for your time.

Here we go again about the Florida Statute 419.001 and the 1,000 feet rule 
in between any group home or any center for people with disabilities. If you 
didn't hear about it yet..I suggest that you learn about it. This is the 
MOST DISCRIMINATORY State law that I ever saw.
WHY CAN OUR PEOPLE LIVE WHERE EVER THEY WANT..You don't see any laws 
regarding older people, or black people or white people or GREEN people..But 
yet you see in the FLORIDA rules..this particular State law,
forbidden people with disabilities to live next to each other.
Now, I want to clear up something, I DO NOT HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THIS 
MATTER..DON'T HAVE A GROUP HOME OR ANYTHING..THIS STATE LAW JUST MAKE ME 
MAD....BECAUSE IT IS SOOOOOOO..UNFAIR. IT WAS CREATE BY PARENTS BELIEVE IT 
OR NOT...STOPPING PEOPLE TO RUN DOWN GROUP HOMES AND SUCH..
MY BELIEVE IN ALL THIS IS THAT LAW IS JUST THERE TO STOP HANDICAPPED PEOPLE 
TO BE TOGETHER...FOR WHAT REASON??? BECAUSE MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF 
DEVALUATION OF LAND...THAT IS THE WAY I SEE IT.
Should WE let that happening to US..NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO....
It is the same thing if TOMORROW...a new state law would read..HISPANIC OR 
WHATEVER..CAN'T LIVE FROM 1,000 feet to each other...THIS IS MORE THAN 
RIDICULEOUS...
I AM COUNTING ON YOU ON THIS ONE..I WILL be there next Thursday to voice my 
opinion...
NO ONE SHOULD MAKE A STOP TO OUR FREEDOM..WE ARE IN AMERICA...THINK ABOUT 
IT...WE HAD FOUGHT SO MANY TIME FOR THIS FREEDOM....
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND HOPE TO HAVE A FEW PEOPLE ON OUR SIDE NEXT 
THURSDAY...

PS: I would like to add that the FDDC is not in favoritism to remove this 
State law..at my BIG disappointment.

Dear Governor:
   I'm sitting here in the office cleaning up as I face that endless trip to China where we are groundbreaking for our Hong Kong Disneyland.  Without the benefit of living in Florida or doing the necessary research about Florida, the one thing that comes to mind is transportation.  A Trans-Florida High Speed Rail could be your "Man-On-The-Moon" idea.  The idea seems to be well advanced in the planning and is supported by business and economic leaders across the State.   Of course not everybody agrees with the route (I'll let somebody else present the Disney point of view,) but I remain optimistic that the Tampa to Orlando leg can be built at minimal public cost.  Such a high speed transportation system would make history in this country.  And it's needed.  I only wish we had it in California.
   The escalating cost of workers’ compensation and healthcare insurance are two very important issues, and I know you are already on top of those.  And my advice on the budget is the last thing you need.  Therefore I come back to transportation.
   I will think more about your question on the plane going West.  Until then, happy New Year.  
 
Michael

Yes, it was a great trip! We had a great time. All the Bushes had a great time and so did all I spoke to. I felt obliged to be a goodwill ambassador since I view the cruise industry embarking from Florida as part of my domain.
 
The ship is beautiful. No plastic and lots of wood all around. The cast members were first class. The food was great. I didn't go to the shows, my dad and mom did, and they said it was great. 
 
I am not sure I could handle a seven day cruise but I have mastered the three day one and I would go back. 
 
Just read the Forbes (or was it Fortune) piece on Disney and I am optimistic about your company's future. I would invest if I had any money. I see the synergy (on the cruise it was awesome) in all that you do. By the way, I spent Christmas at the Boardwalk Hotel to be with our daughter. We had a great time and were treated fantastic. John, the cast member who helped us during our days there, is first rate. He deserves a raise! He is so focused on your mission of customer service that I was tempted to attempt to steal him for state government service.
 
Happy New Year.

Subject: RE: 


Thanks for the email, Jeb. I am honored and I will take it to heart. Sorry I was away for the week and couldn't get to it until now.
 
I believe in fundamental freedoms and completely free markets and am very much driven that way. So hear my suggestions with that bias.
 
Off the cuff, there are a few things I am thinking about. They are all pretty radical, and since you are so close to being our next President, you might want to be careful about which ones, if any you might pursue.
 
Fundamentally in the US,
Our school system doesn't work
Our prison system is not ideal
Medicine is poorly delivered.
 
All major state issues
 
On education, I would suggest breaking the union, or at least ending tenure. Since unilaterally doing this might be tough, you might want to work with all the other Governors who have good hearts and do something all at once. My suggestion would be to do it in May. Don't renegotiate with the unions. Spend the next three months recruiting teachers from the pool of active parents and scabs will cross over. Put all the principals in charge to hire and fire during the Summer so they can build their team for the new year. No safety net for teachers. And I would raise their average pay slightly, but leave it up to the Principal to determine individual salaries.
 
On prisons, I have an even more radical thought. Privitize all the prisons and allow them to "bid" for prisoners. Let's say we are both prison wardens. I bid $200k to put some killer away for 15 years, and you bid $185k. You get him. He is now your responsibility. If he escapes or dies of unnatural causes, you owe the state $1 million. If he does anything again, you have to put him up. But if, when released, he becomes a good citizen, you get 25% of any taxes he pays to the state. As a warden, you are now motivated to keep him inexpensively, make sure he never breaks the law again and train him for a career while he is there.
 
In medicine, it is very complicated and it gets to the issue of "what is a life worth?" And, are some lives worth more than others?
I think the states should probably have a safety net here where some level of health care is given out as though the taxpayer is actually paying the insurance for all the people of the state, but rather than having rules on what the docs can and can't do, the market should do its magic. Individuals who want further coverage beyond the basics will have to buy their own coverage. 
 
 
 
I don't know how you get to any of these solutions politically, except if they are clearly the right way to go, and you just have to overcome unions to get there, work with the other Governors. 
 
One other thing. On tort reform, once you have put a price on a life, I think it would be easy to determine the maximum award of damages in a personal injury case.
 
I am game to talk about these issues in further detail any time. I just read The Tipping Point, and there is something in there about crime and how it comes about that might be worth your time.
 
 
All the best,
Tim

Dear Governor Bush,
I just heard on Fox News that two thirds of malpractice awards go to
trail attorneys. My son (Ron) and daughter in law (Lisa) are both
pediatricians working in the Clearwater/Tampa area. Lisa is a specialist
in neo-natal care which by definition is a "high risk" field.. She is
currently working on a month to month basis because of the cost of
malpractice insurance. They both are having serious thoughts about
continuing their practice in Florida!

Don't you think it is about time that the State of Florida do something
about malpractice insurance for Doctors?

I hope to see you January  7th.

I know you are getting excited about all the events upcoming.......as well you should be.  Let's hope we get warmer weather this time out than we did the last!!
 
Jeb, I have a dear friend and supporter, Andy Haggard, that is coming up to Tally for all the events. He has expressed his desire to say "thank you" personally for the appointment you made of him to the FSU Board.  He'll be with me most of the time and I'd just like to know when you think the best time and place for this brief handshake and short communication to take place.  He doesn't want a meeting, and he doesn't want anything.  He is so terribly excited about the contributions he can make to FSU's future that he wants to tell you of his appreciation.  Let me know what event you think the most appropriate and the least invasive of your time and other commitments.
 
See you soon, Gov....and I'm looking forward to it.  By the way, Linda and I really appreciate your calling us on Christmas.  What a really nice gesture!  I'll remember that!

Dear Governor Bush,
 
 
     With great interest, I have been following the appointment of Colleen Castille and the realignment of the The Department of Community Affairs.  I sincerely hope and pray that State oversight on land use decisions will be strenghtened.  Local as well as regional decisions need to be challenged when the negatives outweigh the benefits for the public interest.
 
     Please keep the checks and balance system.  It is necessary. Everything cannot be trusted to the local and regional level.  St. Johns County is in a mess as a result of poor planning and the officials think that they have done a good job.

Here's where we are with our case.....The birth mother surrendered her rights on November 25th....It has been over 30 days and we are going to court Monday at 10:00 with JUDGE MOSES BAKER...The Birth Father's rights were never terminated by the Judge...We had our attorney prepare the surrender papers and they were sent to him in prision. Via phone,he will be present for the Judge to accept his voluntary termination. 


Second, everyone involved,included DCF has agreed that the baby belongs with us and should stay with us...The issue is that DCF does not want this to become a private adoption. Three weeks ago, we had a hearing and the Judge Baker overruled it and told DCF to keep their ego's out of his courtroom......Tim Beasley threawtened that he would fight this to the end! 


At the trial on this Monday, we are praying and everyone is praying that DCF does not appeal and contest this order...If so, Dave this could stay in the system for 2 years.  We met with our attorney yesterday and she is said Tim Beasley is no longer with the department, but the new attorney for DCF seems more reasonable. DCF wants to terminate the mothers rights,but SHE HAS VOLUNTARILY DONE SO ON NOVEMBER 25TH. 


Lastly, we had an independent homestudy completed and approved on our own. CHS has dragged their feet.....Now their is another issue with them, and me being approved. But Sue Barton (DCF) will not approve me....I wrote Governor Bush in April about a situation with me 7 years ago, he forwarded it to Lori Day and she encouraged me to foswter/adopt through the State of Florida. Now, after 9 months, they are telling me that now their is a problem. 


But all of the legal people involved have indicated that what happened (no conviction/probation or anything) cannot pose a problem...... 


Please advise as to how to handle this mess.   AllI wanted to do was save a life, and both my husband and I love this little baby so much and don'twant to loose him. 


Thank you for your ear.

Dear Mrs. Stefani Glaser Anthes:

Thank you for your October 25 e-mail to Governor Bush regarding your
concerns about your adoption home study and the termination of parental
rights involving the child that you have custody of. The Governor has
asked me to respond to you on his behalf.

My staff have informed me that Children's Home Society (CHS) is completing
the adoption study of your family. The CHS has reported that they were
attempting to schedule an appointment with you and your husband. They had
recently received a telephone message from Mr. Anthes on October 31, 2002
about some available times on the following day which the caseworker,
Nicole Monack, was not able to accommodate. The caseworker had telephoned
Mr. Anthes on November 7, 2002 and requested a call back to schedule the
appointment. I have not been updated since November 7, 2002 on this,
however, if further assistance is needed you may contact Darlene Levy
from the Children's Home Society at (561) 844-9785.

I have learned that the trial for the termination of parental rights in
regard to the father was held on September 12, 2002. I have been further
informed that the judge who heard this trial does not usually rule from the
bench in termination of parental rights cases because he wishes to review
all the evidence before rendering a verdict. A recent contact regarding
the status of this order revealed that it should be forthcoming in the near
future. In regard to the termination of parental rights of the mother, I
have been informed that the case was re-staffed on October 3, 2002 and the
decision was made to pursue the termination of her parental rights. I have
been further informed that the Foster Children's Project Attorney filed
this termination of parental rights petition on behalf of the mother on
November 7, 2002. If further information is needed regarding this you may
contact Mary Bosco from the Department of Children and Families at (561)
841-2175.

I hope this information is of assistance to you.

You know that I am working hard to adopt Russian children here in this country.  Since working on this program I have had many contacts with local agencies, and I am learning a lot about our situation in this State.  Mainly the new law that went into effect last year.  I am sure you are aware about it and the problems it has caused concerning new mothers having to have their name and picture in the paper in order to find the father.   I would surely like to help you and be involved in making the process of adoption easier for families and less traumatic for mothers and fathers who make the brave decision to give up their children, and then make sure that the best interest of the child is taken into consideration.  I would like to offer my services in anyway possible and would be happy speak with you about this process in greater detail

Subject: RE: 
You never let up, do you!?  OK, here goes.
 
RE: REVENUE SOURCES
 
1.      Find a way to collect sales tax on internet and other purchased deliveries in Florida.  This is a huge loop hole and needs to be fixed.  Can  the federal government help in legislation this year to make it easier for shippers to collect and remit the tax?  Can you be the catalyst in the effort with the state's US senators and congressmen?  I don't know which legislative committee in Congress would be responsible for this but certainly Hastert, Fritz, and the White House --Nick Callio (?)  would get involved if they shared your sense of urgency.  
 
2.      Failing that,   you should try to organize a cooperative effort  amongst the states to collect each others taxes and remit.   We already discussed this on a previous e-mail. 
 
3.      I have an unconfirmed but abiding suspicion that many people in Florida don't pay their intangible taxes on the theory that the state has been pretty inept in  enforcing  the collection.  This was long the attitude among many people I know.  Am not sure of the extent of that pervasive thought today.   I realize that your beefing up collection capability flies in the face of your desire to eliminate this tax, but if that doesn't happen this year I would dare say there is a lot of money being left on the table you should go after-and in good conscience. 
 
4.      Go after the unrighteous sales tax exemptions---no conservative will fault you for this.  
 
COST SAVINGS
 
1.      I think it would be very useful to resurrect the opportunity to have a free diagnostic done on additional ways the state can save money through centralized purchasing.  I was very impressed with the presentation that Dave Wenner from McKinsey & Co. made  and his proposal was very compelling.  I believe that the only reason that Cynthia Henderson  turned him down was because of a very strong personal negative reaction to him and the way he made his proposal.  Wenner said that he was confident  that there were additional opportunities to save several hundreds of million dollars over and above what was contracted out beginning in the first six months of implementation!  It would cost the state nothing to find this out.   Why not find out?
 
 CLASS SIZE---EDUCATION
 
1.      I think your best hope here is to implement the most draconian solutions to meeting the requirements of the amendment at the least cost---double sessions, more bussing, etc.-all in the effort to create a groundswell of public opinion to overturn this initiative at the first opportunity.  I know that classroom space and  capital cost  is only one element of the problem, and you would have to renegotiate current teachers' work schedules to enable these longer hours as well as hire new teachers.
 
     2.   If it is true that Florida needs 160,000 new teachers over the next ten years and Florida only 
            turns out about 5600 certified teachers per year-with only 60% going into the public school   
            system, it is obvious we will never come close to filling the need with the same old methods .
            Besides confirming that Florida is competitive in salaries,  continuing to work to place the best    
            principals in the schools,  in my opinion there has to be a revolutionary shift in thought and 
            practice on how we get teachers.  We not only need to expand the alternative certification 
            programs to more quickly bring  associate (intern) teachers into the system but we should
            work to change the criteria for certification-to allow perfectly competent and intelligent and
            successful people who don't necessarily have an education degree  to get certified to teach!
            This is already being done in the community college system and they are great teachers. If we 
             don't do something like this we will never meet the goal. 
 
            One of Florida's greatest untapped human resources is its large percentage of young retirees.  
            Many are looking for something to keep them busy, let alone a new career.  Devise a method 
            of recruiting more of them into teaching!
 
 TORT REFORM
 
1.      I know this is a high priority issue with you and you have done great things on the Supreme  
Court.  Getting the legislature to share your sense of urgency, particularly with the Senate leadership is going to be critical.  Lots of people and lots of organizations are doing lots of things, but it would be helpful if we could review with you  and your people  those efforts to see where the aces and spaces are.  High priority to turn up the PR aspects to drive the sense of urgency and communicate the personal devastating effect of these high liability awards on insurance rates and the concomitant effects-doctors leaving the state, businesses turning into a loss situation, or even electing to live without insurance.
 
WATER
 
1.      This is the biggest long term problem facing Florida-as big as education in my opinion. 
Again, there has to be a paradigm shift as to how we think of this, and it is going to require controlling  policy  at the state level  and implementation at the regional level-just like DOT.  Interdependence of one region on another is a principle that will ultimately have to be adopted by all.   More on this when we brief you at the end of Jan. 
 
 
STRUCTURE OF THE EOG
 
                The country has probably never before seen a Governor with such a sense of urgency and             
                 healthy discontent with the way things are.  Your ideas and vision for the state, resulted  in   
                 many initiatives which created a tornado of activity in your office, straining the traditional 
                 staff structure to the limit. Creating initiatives took up most of your effort and attention, as   
                 well as getting the legislature on board, being the front man on all these efforts.  And this is                           
                 where Kathleen focused her effort too---your needs demanded that. 
 
                 What suffered was the follow-up on the execution orders given to your agency heads. 
                 I know that you have divvied up the agencies to your deputy chiefs of staff, but they are too    
                 busy or too inexperienced  to effectively work with the department heads on a continuing   
                 and participatory basis.  What you need, in my opinion, is a long in the tooth full time chief 
                 operations officer whose job is to regularly go to the agencies and work with them---at their             
                 offices, to help them implement your orders.  You just don't have enough time to effectively                  
                 do this, and neither does Kathleen.  That's exactly why I have a COO too-I just couldn't do           
                 the extracurricular things that I do without him  That is why I think your merging the Sec'y 
                 of State's  function with DCF is a good idea, not so much because it makes sense from 
                 a functional viewpoint, but because it allowed you to attract an experienced manager 
                 who is in effect your chief operating officer for two agencies---taking some of the workload 
                 off you.  By finding someone like Glenda to take on the other agencies would help you 
                 immeasurably.    This is what a good LG might do. (?)  
 
                 
Well, Jeb, you have some of my thoughts for this year.  You are good at listening to advice, and also very good at masking your personal opinions until you are ready to announce an action plan.  But
I would truly love your reaction to some of these items.  I have others I don't want to put in writing and would like to share with you in person but they are personal in nature-more about you and not the job.   I will wait until we can visit privately.  (Boy, do I feel emboldened!)
 
As always, love and devotion,
 
Al.

Congrats on you new term and Happy New Year.

Just wanted to let you know of a possible opportunity to spread some good grace amoungst the Black Community.  As you probably know the Tuskegee Airmen were the first Afro-American pilots in the US Military during World War II.  The local "Chappie James" Chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen are having a fund raising dinner for their scholarship program on February 22 at the Renassance Hotel north of the Orlando International Airport.  One of the Airmen mentioned to me that he thought you had missed to boat with the Black voters for some reason (I am sure you hear it all) and I thought I would give you a heads up that this event was happening.  I understand that Senator Nelson and I are being honored at the event.  I restored one of my early P-51 Mustang aircraft in the colors of their highest scoring pilot and was nationally voted in as an Honorary Tuskegee Airman last summer at their national convention in Atlanta.  I would not have mentioned this except the Senator was coming.  Just a thought, you might want to check with him and get his read on the whole deal.

Hello, Governor Bush,

How to Speak DOEse - Theresa Willingham 

Early last year, when I requested some material from the Florida Department of Education's Home Education office for our homeschool group, I noticed some inconsistencies on both the DOE website and in the homeschool packages. They were, I felt, misleading and inaccurate. Only one state support group was listed, along with disproportionate amounts of material from the Home School Legal Defense Association, creating an impression of endorsement and support of these private groups by a state agency. When I first pointed this out to the home education office, I didn't realize I was embarking on a nearly four month long email odyssey through the virtual, but convoluted halls of bureaucratic convention and apparent marriages of convenience between the DOE and other organizations. 


"I think Florida is a great homeschooling state," I wrote to the office, in late January. "I have some concerns, however, about the DOE sending out materials from the Home School Legal Defense Association. It pretty much amounts to providing free - and misleading - advertising for a private law firm. If you're going to include the HSLDA in your package, I would expect that other law firms would be included as well. 


"The same issue appears with the preponderance of FPEA (Florida Parent Education Association) materials. There are many, many other resources for obtaining unbiased, accurate information for homeschoolers and I'm concerned that the Department of Education's Choice Office is simply taking the easy way out by supplying Florida homeschoolers with biased and possibly unreliable - or at best, misleading - information by a small but overbearing segment of the homeschooling community. Who can I address my concerns to for some specific feedback about these issues?" 


At first I received strong assurances that my impressions were wrong. 


"We have placed the Home School Legal Defense Association literature in the district packets because the graphs and literature are helpful in describing profiles of some families," an office representative replied. "There is no one organization that speaks for homeschoolers, and after my years in the area I try to be careful and balanced with people who contact this office. There are a couple of Q&A in the HSLDA that I have called about before you began to email me. In no way will this office ever give preferential treatment to any individual or organization...." S he also added that she felt a telephone conversation about these issues might be more "personal" than email. 


I replied that I didn't wish to be personal but rather to discuss, "with maturity and professionalism, the business of the Department of Education and the services you provide Florida residents." 


I think this is vital with any government agency: Communications should never be reduced to a "personal" level, in any sense of the word. All communications should always be in writing, dated, and specifically referenced whenever possible. It's important to have records of discussions, and that proved especially valuable in this case. Correspondence should be conducted as professionally as possible, keeping in mind that your communications will be saved as well. 


I didn't feel my concerns were adequately addressed, I explained, and asked if I should send my inquiries to another office. Almost immediately, I received an angry phone call from the person I'd been corresponding with. (I had given her my phone number when I had originally requested the homeschooler packages.) She was highly agitated, and proceeded to rail against what she called my "unjustified accusations." When I tried to explain I'd only meant to suggest the DOE broaden its resources, and at another point that I was sure appearances of impropriety were inadvertent, she told me not to interrupt. The tirade continued for several minutes. When she finally stopped, I remained silent for a few seconds, then asked, "May I speak now?" She angrily replied, "You can do whatever you want!" 


So much for the personal touch, I thought. But I held my tongue, uttering instead some benign comments that allowed us to hang up somewhat amicably. But I was shaken and upset. And the more I thought about it the more outrageous the whole thing seemed - that a DOE employee would actually call a citizen to complain about that citizen's input regarding a government agency that ostensibly existed to assist citizens! 


Two days later, I took my issues, which now included the ill behavior of a state employee, to the next couple of levels - the employee's supervisor and the Commissioner of Education's office. I forwarded both offices copies of my correspondence with the Home Ed office, as well as a description of our telephone conversation. 


When I didn't hear back from either, I tried the Governor's "Citizen's Help Desk," then went in search of an oversight agency. I knew there had to be one but had no idea where to start. I typed "government watchdog" in an Internet search engine, and among the offerings was the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA). Quite a mouthful; but the organization, charged with "improv[ing] the performance and accountability of state government through reviews of state agencies and their programs," seemed to be just what I needed. 


Browsing their site, I found a feedback form to "contact us with information you may have regarding apparent program inefficiencies or mismanagement with state government," completed it and sent it in. 


A couple of days later, with no response from anyone, I followed up once again, with the rather plaintive subject heading "Could Someone Please Respond?" And I took a broader view of the problem, hoping to appeal to the supervisor more as a citizen, than as a homeschooler. 


"My concern here," I explained, "is that the antagonistic response I received does not invite communication. It does not encourage vital citizen inquiry or participation in this important aspect of our state government. Residents should be able to make a comment to a government office or leader without fear of chastisement or intimidation, no matter how much that office may disagree with the comment. We are governed by consent - this is what I teach our children. But communication is integral to that agreement between the governing and the governed, and I feel that perhaps [the coordinator] has forgotten this foremost principle of democracy." 


I said I had sent copies of all my correspondence and inquiries to multiple government agencies multiple times, and added, "I write to you now, as one person to another, for a simple human acknowledgement of the concerns that I have as a citizen of Florida. I have copies of all my correspondence, and I stand by my observation that the DOE is not communicating well, efficiently or comprehensively with Florida residents - and so far, no one has made any effort to prove me wrong. I certainly hope that you will." 


I received an immediate and rather promising reply, with an apology from the DOE, and an invitation to "start again." 


"As an agency we make every effort to not become merely advertisers for products, but to provide as much information to parents as possible. ...Over the years many home educators prefer not to have an association with the department and we respect their wishes. Our mission is to help where and when we have the authority," I read. "Please feel free to call me directly if I can be of assistance to you. ...If you have any other suggestions or recommendations regarding the web page on home education and how we can better serve families, please let me know." 


I responded enthusiastically, acknowledging gratefully the invitation to begin again. 


"I suppose the reason I believe that I have not been served well by your office is because my concerns... have been dismissed out of hand," I replied. "The reason I pointed out the impression of impropriety in the first place was because I was sure that, as you said, you don't want to be "mere advertisers" for products - including law services - and that's exactly what all the materials from the HSLDA seem to imply - that you are advertising for them. ...it doesn't seem right to solely endorse the HSLDA by providing so many of their materials - especially when the information they provide is readily available through unbiased, comprehensive federal DOE resources." 


I also saw this as an opportunity to open a broader dialogue for all homeschoolers in the state. 


"Perhaps you've been told that many home educators do not want an association with your office," I wrote, "but the truth is that most do not know that they CAN have an association with your office." 


A week went by with no reply. I followed up once, then again. I got a brief note advising me that the office was busy but that the resources I had sent earlier would be up on the website soon. Another week went by, and I followed up once more - just a line or two asking if my previous correspondence had been received and how the website updates were progressing. I received a short, terse note advising me that the legislative session was under way and that there were many other homeschooling parents who were equally as important as I, and that I would be attended to "as soon as possible." 


I was being blown off and I knew it. Perhaps they expected me to be mollified by the initial note of apology. Perhaps they assumed that I would forget to check back on the progress of the website, or that if enough time went by, I would simply give up. I did neither. 


"Is there someone else to whom I should be addressing my inquiries, so that I'm not taking up your time?" I asked. "You told me, specifically, "If you have any other suggestions or recommendations regarding the web page on home education and how we can better serve families, please let me know." I responded comprehensively, politely, and with an interest in assisting in any way I can, and yet I continue to be made to feel as though I'm imposing on your office by communicating with it -- and expecting it to communicate back. 


"So I'll apologize for bothering you, but will remind you that this is, indeed, our legislative session, and while I may not be among those parents lobbying for particular bills or special interests, I am among those parents whom you serve and whose interests and needs are just as important and just as deserving of respect and attention. ..." 


By now my letters were lengthy with copies of previous correspondence. I ensured the DOE knew that I had copies of everything, that I was paying attention to where we were in the conversation and focused on resolving the issues I had raised in the first place. Friends who knew of this now two-month-old conversation lamented my lack of progress. "Couldn't your time be better spent elsewhere?" they asked. 


But I never leave things unfinished, and my principles were at stake. The website had been incomplete for years, and the homeschool information packages were inaccurate. If I quit now, nothing would change. And I knew that things would change if I persisted, politely, pointedly, and patiently. So I did. 


On Feb. 25, I received one more note from the choice office, confirming that they were indeed, the proper agency for home education issues. 


With an apparent air of resignation, the letter read: "More often than not, other offices and divisions will forward correspondence and calls to us. Because the Department does not regulate or license private schools (and therefore private education) and given that home education is home based and true parent choice, there are very few program specialists in the Department that are familiar with issues that are not totally related to public education and the delivery of services as outlined in statute. 


"And as you know, local school districts have at least one person assigned to respond to local home education questions and registration of students in home education. So send your correspondence to me and we will do what we can to assist you." 


I sent thanks, and reiterated my inquiries about department visibility and improved relationships with the homeschooling community, HSLDA concerns and the offering of comprehensive, unbiased educational resources on the website and in the homeschool packages. I never heard back from that office again. 


I continued to follow up weekly or every couple of weeks. I filed another complaint with the Governor's office, receiving a brief note that my letter would be forwarded to the Commissioner of Education's office. I replied that I had already done that and never heard back from them either, but hoped that perhaps the Governor's office could help. 


After a couple of weeks of silence, I wrote the Governor's office again. I received pseudo-apology: "I am sorry that you feel that you have not been responded to adequately by the Department of Education and the Choice Office" with a promise to forward my note once more and a wish that everything would soon be resolved to my satisfaction. 


Once again, I got the distinct feeling that my efforts were somehow being redirected, with smoke and mirrors to distract me from the original problem. 


"Thank you for your note," I wrote back, determined to keep the focus where it belonged. "But the reason I feel that I have not been responded to adequately is because I haven't been. If you wish to apologize, apologize for the fact of the matter - that I have not been responded to adequately - and not for my "feelings" to that effect, as if the problems I've encountered communicating with the Governor's Office and the Department of Education are simply figments of my imagination. Thank you for forwarding my note again. I do appreciate it. But please understand that this needs to be resolved, not to my satisfaction, but because it's the right thing to do." 


Then, just when I was getting ready to write my Congressman, I received a note from the Office for Program Policy Analysis. I had almost forgotten them. 


They wrote, "We will be conducting a review of the Department in general later this year as part of the Legislature's Zero Based Budgeting initiative and will consider the input you have provided at that time." In the meantime, they added, perhaps I'd like to contact the DOE's Inspector General's Office. "Hope this is helpful." 


Was it ever! I wrote to the Inspector General's office, mentioning that I had been referred by the OPPAGA and received an immediate response, inviting me to send them copies of all my correspondence with the DOE, and actually thanking me for bringing the situation to their attention. Two weeks later, on May 1, I was advised that my case had been turned over to - ta da! - the Website Master. It had only taken nearly four months to get everything to the department where it belonged in the first place, but now it was there with authority. 


A week later, I received a telephone call from a conflict resolution officer at the DOE saying he would like to implement the changes. He felt the best way to include new support resources was to accept information only from the "legitimate representatives" of state and local organizations, to verify that such information was being provided fairly and with permission. To that end, he asked me to send him information for groups of which I was the legitimate representative, and he would include them on the website. 


I thanked him and sent along all the information he requested. The only vagary occurred when I asked if there would be some mention on the website of how other home educators could submit information. "We could do that," he replied, implying there was no intention of doing so. So when I sent my information, I assured him that as soon as the new site was up and running, I would let other area home educators know they could now have their support groups listed. 


On May 21, I received a note telling me that the new website was up. Sure enough, besides the FPEA were our LIFE of Florida group, our local LIFE chapter and our national UU Homeschoolers group. There is no invitation to submit other groups, but word is out concerning how to do so, and hopefully new groups will soon appear on the site. 


It took time, and it took patience, but when I look at the DOE website and know that what I see there now I made possible, I feel good, and strong, and reassured that I can affect the world around me, simply on the strength of my convictions. And that's a very satisfying thought. 


An Update 


In the intervening months, communication with the Department of Education's Office of Choice, now under new administrative guidance, has improved considerably for residents. I believe a number of changes are responsible for that, not the least of which was an ongoing DOE reorganization that was taking place at the same time that I waged for website improvements and better service for homeschoolers. But I believe only continued frank and frequent communications with the DOE (and any government agency), with requests for and strong expectations of, answers when we need them, and service when we want it, will best serve participatory democracy and our individual needs as home educators. 


Additional Information 


Steps in Learning to Speak DOEse 


• First, learn your way around your state Department of Education. You can find your DOE's home page at http://www.ccsso.org/seamenu.html 


• Look for a Home Education or Homeschooling link on the state DOE page. If, after looking over the page, you determine that there is misleading or erroneous information on it, start at the beginning, contacting, via writing, the suggested "help" contact or administrator. 


• Present your case amicably and politely, always starting with the assumption that the state's error is mere oversight and that they'll be grateful for your help. That takes a lot more than a grain of salt, I know, but at least start with this assumption. And sometimes it simply is an oversight and they'll be happy to correct it. 


• I suggest waiting no more than two or three days for a reply before following up, with a dated copy of your previous correspondence. You don't need to say much, just wonder aloud if they received your first note and tell them you've attached it for their convenience. Remember that everything you say - and everything that they say -- will be public record, so be scrupulously polite, mature and professional, no matter what! 


• If, after two follow ups, you've either received no response, or an insufficient response, go up to the next level, that person's supervisor. That can be a little tricky. Sometimes relevant staff will be listed right on a webpage. At other times, you'll have to do some investigating. One thing you can do is simply call your DOEs help/parent/information number and request the name of the head of a department, or the name of someone's supervisor. Often, there's an online "help desk" or "contact" address, and you can inquire there. There are also online organizational charts or directories. Again, remain polite. No one needs a long story. Just ask your question. 


• After you've determined who the supervisor is, present your case again, this time with copies of previous correspondence to the other employee. Go through the same wait and follow up procedure. If you're still unsatisfied, go right to the State Superintendent or Education Commissioner and, with copies to your Governor's office, state your case once more. 


• This might also be a good time to start tracking down your state's version of an oversight committee for the DOE, because at this point, if you've received no proper response to your inquiries and concerns, the issue becomes one of government ethics. In Florida, it's the DOE Inspector General's office. I had to go through an outside government oversight group to find it, and that's yet another way to locate such an agency. But usually, you can just run a search on, say, "South Carolina's Department of Education oversight" and something will pop up. In many other states, it's an Inspector General's office as well. 


There is an excellent overview of oversight agencies and their roles at the US Office of Government Ethics at www.usoge.gov/home.html. If you want to contact them, you need to write or call: U.S. Office of Government Ethics, 1201 New York Ave., NW. Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005-3917, Phone: 202-208-8000 , TDD: 202-208-8025, Fax: 202-208-8037 


The OGE is charged with, "The Office of Government Ethics exercises leadership in the executive branch to prevent conflicts of interest on the part of Government employees, and to resolve those conflicts of interest that do occur. In partnership with executive branch agencies and departments, OGE fosters high ethical standards for employees and strengthens the public's confidence that the Government's business is conducted with impartiality and integrity." If all else fails, this agency can probably steer you to the appropriate state agency. 


Another good resource is the University of Oklahoma's list of State Law Servers at www.law.ou.edu/stateserv.html State and Local Government on the Net, at http://www.statelocalgov.net/index.cfm is a magnificent compilation of links 


At the Inspection and Oversight Document Archive, at www.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/ig/ftpidx.html you can find the names and addresses of each state's oversight agency. 


• Be prepared to present your case clearly and with documentation. It may seem silly to have progressed so far up the chain of command for what is probably a minor problem. But if an agency refuses to work with a citizen, then there is no other recourse than to turn to the oversight agencies in place for this reason. To do anything less is to do nothing. © 2003 Theresa Willingham

Dear Governor Bush
 
  I am writing to you for several reason but my top priority right now is the Bush/Lang case. I have written to you in the past about this child and to date the issue has not been resolved. The state has sent out many mixed signals and finally there is a fair hearing on Jan 14 03 as far as we know. The problem is the family lives in Washington State and can not be here for the hearing however I have offer to attend but it appears as though that is not a comfortable situation for those involved. I am aware of another case that took place on Oct 30 02 where the adoptive family who is from Maine was allowed a phone hearing. In the Bush/Lang case everything that was ordered by Carol Hutcheson had taken place however she decided at some point to not review or make a decision on the adoption subsidy request. Again this was after Carol telling the family to submit medical documentation, after she had denied the child based on race. Medical documentation was sent but than went on to a hearings officer shortly after, to date there has not been a denial on the medical. We were under the impression that the fair hearing would be on the denial for race, now we are finding that the hearing will include the medical as well. The adoptive family also has not gotten anything thing they have requested ie: the entire policy manuel and the documentation the state will be presenting, they have not had the same access to info the state has had. Almost all of the cases I have received in the past four years concerning children adopted from Florida have been those children of black or mixed race, who have been denied equal access to a Federally Mandated Program "Title IV-E" . Something is certainly wrong here. We have asked that this case be investigated. We have also found that Mike Watkins is no longer with the department. How can you have someone work with this family who is no longer available? It appears as though Florida is not a family friendly state. My next concern is from a family who contacted me on 12-30-02 to say that they have given an agency in Longboat over $8000.00 two years ago for a bi-racial child (in Carol's word bi-racial is a special condition therefore making those children highly sought after) to date they have not gotten a child and do not have contact with the agency. I feel that maybe this agency has taken their money with full intensions of not finding a child. My point is I e-mailed Carol Hutcheson to ask were we would direct our complaint and still have not hear from her. Do you have any ideas that may help this family? I feel we need your assistance in resoling these issues. Thank You for all your help.  Donna Families On The Move

Good morning Gov,
 
A few weeks ago the HBC presidents met and started developing a unified strategy and approach to budget and programming issues. Pls note Thrasher and TK attended the meeting. 
After the meeting they approached me and others for advice and support. 
I informed them that it was my belief that their program issues needed to be consistent w/ your policy priorities and program initiatives.   More importantly, I stated that I truly believed that your current efforts/initiatives will benefit African Americans and HBCs in a substantially positive manner. 
It is clear that the HBCs recognize that you have been  a great supporter of HBCs.  They have stated a desire to work closely with you.
I received a call from their representative this morning.  They have been trying to schedule a meeting with you. 
 
They'd like to meet with you in the near future to discuss how they can work more closely with you and your administration.  They'd like to share their ideas on initiatives and programs.  DO YOU HAVE ANY TIME IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS?

We have in inventory 4000 kits which could be quickly deployed to families 
that have a parent away protecting our country.  The kit will help keep the

By Matt Daneman 
Democrat and Chronicle 

(January 2, 2003) — Shirley Thompson is the new president of the Rochester schools Board of Education. 

Thompson was vice president of the board last year. 

The presidency of the seven-member board has been a controversial issue the last several weeks, as former President Joanne Giuffrida fought a move that would reduce the term of the presidency to one year. The board on Dec. 5 adopted new rules for itself that included halving the president’s term to one year and stripping away some of the presidential power. 

Giuffrida _ halfway into her two-year term as president _ filed an appeal with the state, arguing that the board cannot change the term of office midstream for the person serving as president. She also asked state Education Commissioner Richard Mills to overturn the district bylaw changes and rule on the validity of the board’s rule changes.

Mills ruled on Tuesday that the state would not stop the officer elections at Thursday night’s board meeting.

Subject: Future of Bert Fish Medical Center


Mr. Bush,
 
I am a private practitioner in New Smyrna Beach and am very concerned about how fragile the environment for access of medical care has become in the area.  I know that you have been made aware of this problem recently from one of my patients, David Biddulph.  I have felt powerless in this situation since it began when BFMC merged with Halifax Medical Center several years ago.  I did not realize the potential implications that this affiliation could have until about one year ago when the contract with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Florida was terminated.  Just this month I had to terminate my relationship with about 100 patients because Aetna’s hospital contract with BFMC was also terminated.  This situation has infuriated these and several hundred Blue Cross patients just within my practice.  These citizens pay taxes for this hospital and cannot use it!  I was a Blue Cross member myself and had the luxury of being able to change that situation.  Most of the patients are retirees from large corporations in the north and have no say about their insurance coverage.
 
Since Mr. Biddulph and I first talked about this situation only about four weeks ago, we have enlisted most of the active members of the medical staff at BFMC and have patients signing a petition in support of a citizen vote for the future of our only hospital.  The response has been tremendous so far.  It seems rather obvious that a vote would be appropriate to gauge what the tax payers want to do with their hospital.
 
You will soon be making five appointments to the Southeast Volusia County Hospital Taxing District Board. I hope you will consider the petitions of citizens who support four candidates who have pledged to give voters the opportunity to decide the future of Bert Fish Hospital. Those four applicants are: Dr Susan Hole, Michael Thompson, Pastor Robert B Thomas and David Biddulph.
 
Many citizens, including myself, feel we have been left out by your predecessor's appointees who reached an agreement to affiliate with Halifax behind closed doors. Those meetings were later found to be unconstitutional. Now when we ask them for information about the contract negations between Halifax-Fish and Blue Cross, we are told the information is not public.  
 
Many wonder if Florida Health Care, a wholly owned subsidiary of Halifax-Fish, is being given preferential treatment in “negotiating” their reimbursement rates. While the public has no access to current information, the court-ordered release of minutes from the secret meetings between Fish and Halifax board members revealed the fact that the contract between Florida Health Care and Halifax was “intentionally under priced” so the hospital would not make any money and the profits would go to Florida Health Care.
 
Since the affiliation a few years ago, our taxes have been increased by your predecessor's appointees over 40%. Thousands of homeowners, including myself, have been without the use of the hospital for almost a year. It appears that thousands of Aetna clients will also be denied use of Bert Fish Hospital as of the first of the year. 
 
Several doctors have closed their practice and many others are considering the same because of the loss in revenues and impracticality of using hospitals outside the area.
 
The election these four applicants are committed to would be non-binding and involve an additional expense. We would want every registered voter to be mailed a ballot and a complete voter guide that in plain English gave the pro and con arguments for each of three proposals as follows:
 
1.	Continue the current “Affiliation” with Halifax Hospital 

2.	Return Bert Fish to a stand-alone hospital 

3.	End Bert Fish Hospital’s “Affiliation” with Halifax Hospital and join with a reputable non-profit or for-profit hospital group which offers to end property taxes while providing continuing care to the indigent. 
 
Mr. Bush, almost ten years ago you supported the idea that voters should decide about new taxes, will you now help the citizens of Southeast Volusia County Hospital Taxing District have their voice heard about the future of the hospital they voted to build with a new tax over 50 years ago?  Please consider these applicants as they may be the only chance that a fair environment for both access and providing medical care can exist in this community.
 
Sincerely,
 
Greg J. Mercurio, MD

Dear Governor Bush,

As one of the many who helped you to become and remain our Governor, now my entire neighborhood is asking you to help us with a very serious flooding problem due to construction.

Here is the scenario. We moved from Tampa to Wesley Chapel in 1986, so my kids could grow up in the country, have horses, and learn about a more peaceful living. We cherished our home and the country living!  All that has been changed a year ago when Sturgess Construction began to clearcut over 200 acres right next to us and elevated the land several feet. Not only we had to contend with the never ending assault of dump trucks, dust blowing as in the Sahara, but now we have also been flooded. The entire neighborhood is under water, and where horses grazed in the pasture just a couple years ago, now we have 2-3 feet of water. We never had problems with the water since we live here. Never been flooded, in fact my pond was almost dry during the recent drought.

Along with my neigbours I called SW Florida Water Management, filed a complaint with Pasco County, called the engineering firm (Burcaw Inc.) and talked with the engineer in charge of the project (Chapel Pines on 577 North of State rd 54), but no response and no help so far. Water that was contained in the pond 200 feet from my house is now 10 feet away and is getting closer. Same for many of the neighbors.

Thanks for your help in advance!

wonnderful.
SHE IS A STITCH and will be great fun!
Then she tells me tonight I still have to get to her house through the
cemetary, I can't come to the front door as the roads will be blocked..
Then she tells Darby and I she is "humbling" LeRoy because he thinks he

Have fun!!!
By the way, Darby is coming with me to the inauguration to represent the

Subject: Florida State Film Commissioner Position


After a long conversation with one of Florida's movers and shakers about the state of our business here in Florida; believe I will support IA Business Manager Joe Humphreys for our new State Film Commissioner.

I did some research and found out the week Rebecca decided to step down from office, she called and/or emailed Joe with a push to go after her soon to be open spot.

I myself have seen Joe go from set to set and visit not only with IA members, but with all crew. Finding out what everyone's problems were and how they might deal with them.

I know the Producer from the Denzel Washington project that shot Miami and he thinks also that Joe would be a great replacement for Rebecca and take up where she has left off.

He has tried to write new law for IA and it's members. He has come up through the ranks as a crew member and knows the ins and outs of our business and it's strong and week points from the Florida crew person's view.

He knows the above and below the line pro's and cons. I've seen him talk common sense as well as Union Fact and Rule when facing a problem. Talking as a Floridian crew member trying to make a living first and IA Business Manager next. He thinks of his members as humans with families first and the rules apply where needed next.

We need someone in that office that understands film production and how it is a business more than someone with a political agenda. We need someone who knows the producers face to face and how to talk their language. Not someone who knows how to schmooz politicians.

I have been told by Rebecca and Kathy and all the other Film Commissioners I deal with that Jeb Bush wants facts, figures and solutions not dinners, cigars and smoke blowing.

If you give him real talk by the people who know what's going on and the problems we face and solutions to help make them better; he will listen and help as much as he can.

Joe Humphrey's is that person. I wish we had a Joe Humphreys running this states SAG office and/or the national. I believe I would be better served.

As a member of several unions DGA, SAG, AFTRA, AEA as well as WIF know that people from each of those Unions know Joe and have heard his ideas on how to make their Unions better for Florida. They have heard his ideas on how to bring work home to Florida. They have heard his ideas on how to unite this state in the fight against runaway production.

I believe Joe is the best for this position because he listens to all areas and knows the who's who and watches who helps, who fights and who is full of hot air.

I follow his wake from time to time to find out who I should network with and who I shouldn't. My work load has grown by doing so and I think Florida would grow from having someone who knows our business from the inside out not the other way around.

The fact remains if Rebecca thought enough to push him towards this position why shouldn't we.

I want a leader to replace Rebecca to see her great start to high goals finished. I want someone who brings solutions to our dying business and it's problems. Someone who uses common sense and by listening to it's people to make options and solutions. Not someone who will run to Jeb Bush and state government and say you need to fix this and I don't know how. Someone who is supported by the "In The Trenches Working Film Crew members and Producers of Florida" because this person is and has always been an "In The Trenches Working Crew Member."

The only other people I would support for this office are: 
Suzanne Mercado, Bill Hill or Ex- Texas Governor Ann Richards

Just my opinion.

Go Joe Go

Rob,
 
Happy New Year.
 
You never cease to amaze me, in your belief that smooth rhetoric will make up for a stream of vitriol that you have constantly directed towards me and others in the past year. I am not going to be duped into believing that you have somehow become a reasonable person.
 
Anyone who can engineer a coup to remove a sitting President in the middle of her term, on the flimsiest of grounds, does not deserve my time or respect. I am willing to work on the issues that you outlined in this morning's e-mail, but not with someone as duplicitous as you have proven to be.
 
As I told you at breakfast in July at  Jines,  I wish it was possible to overlook your past words and deeds, but you keep doing the same bad things. And what you and your cronies plan to do tomorrow night to JoAnn is a very bad thing. Since you are determined to proceed, that vote will practically destroy any grounds for collaboration between us.
 
If you come to your senses and drop this ill-conceived proposal, I will take it as a good faith gesture that you have changed your combative approach, and then we can talk about "real" issues.
 
The choice is yours to make. I will be in my office tomorrow. 
 
Bill Johnson

Subject:	Norma Parrish for City Commissioner Seat 3

Dear friends and relatives: Please take the time to review the following information about candidate Norma Parrish for city commission.  This is one sharp lady who can get the job done.  She is a C PA; her mother was on the ground floor in helping establish Tallahassee Community College; she is an FSU graduate and she is full of energy and ideas that Tallahassee needs!! Thanks, Bob Ryals

Some questions that have been asked of me are: What is her background?;


Elect Norma Parrish Feb. 4th City Commissioner Seat 2




A resident of Tallahassee for more than 40 years, Norma Binger Parrish is a Certified Public Accountant, a Chief Financial Officer, a wife and a mother.   She recognizes those things which are most important to Tallahasseeans.  As your full-time city commissioner, she will work tirelessly to protect our neighborhoods and environment without stifling creation of new jobs and wise economic development.   She will be a bridge between city government and the private sector so that local businesses—large and small—can thrive.   Norma Parrish is easy to talk to and a good listener.   Her work with the Auditor Generals Office will translate into better fiscal oversight in city government.   Her work in her family's real estate business has given her firsthand knowledge of the challenges of operating a small business within government regulations.  Her current position as CFO has given her a wealth of experience in making policy decisions and managing a budget totaling over 300 million dollars. Study the candidates.   Weigh their backgrounds.   Then you will know that Norma Parrish is the best person to represent you on the Tallahassee City Commission, Seat 2. 

 

O         Chief Financial Officer,   Office of Stud.  Fin.  Assist. Florida Dept. of Education since 1998

 who is running against her?; 
Mayo Woodward, 31 year old investment advisor with a degree in Sociology 
Jack Traylor florist and insurance consultant,  
Bob Henderson business consultant and served as county commissioner
Joshua Hicks recent high school graduate,
Andrew Gillum, organizer of People for the American Way
 
Why do you think she is a good candidate for business? 
 
Norma Parrish's slogan for what she will do is "It is time for progress, it is time for Parrish"
As a CPA, Norma has the training and skills to focus on the needs of businesses in our community. Her 25 years of experience includes a blend of working in government, serving as a government watchdog, and working in a small business so she is uniquely qualified to shape the policies to attract new businesses to Tallahassee and better serve the existing businesses.   After the Chamber of Commerce completes their study of the permitting process currently performed by the city, Norma will ensure that their recommendations are implemented as well as any other methods successfully used by Jacksonville, Miami and other cities where permits are processed in hours or days instead of weeks.
Her own family is attempting to bring a manufacturing company to the area with an initial 100 new jobs but is running up against regulatory problems! Norma's fiscal experience will enable her to ensure we more effectively use your tax dollars (loss of $2 million in the Fleet department, a separate city election, and the expanded utility bills are a few examples of waste by our city).

Subject:	worth reading, and heeding

I'm forwarding today's "issue" of an e-letter I get that seems to have some frightening confirmation of what I sent last week.
Before reading, consider info I found in newspaperes this weekend
:  WHEN SUBJECT OF INVESTING ARISES - 47% say tone is pessimistic, 44% say its laden with REGRET  (very bad sign, often key to self-condemnation, feelings of foolishness, pledges to avoid such risk in future), 35% say tone has tinge of fear.   Fact is, while prime human motivations are from fear and greed,   fear is far stronger.     
 
Chart showing OVER 60 GROUP AS PERCENTAGE OF 15-59.   In US, 2000 figures:   26%.   Projected for 2050:   49%.   
 
What will happen to Florida revenue if high wages go elsewhere  (not just other states but lots of tech companies are moving HIGH WAGE JOBS OVERSEAS.   
 
add to that the movie this weekend on Enron.    My significant other has invested for more than 30 years.  He reads the news each day.  He closely followed the stories on Enron and Worlcom and such.    He watched 5 years of IRA contributions DISAPPEAR.      But after seeing the movie and really SEEING what went on, even if it was exaggerated,     He said he had nightmares about it.  The the news in the paper today about boomer retirement, stock market selloff, 40% dependent on SS, etc.     
 
I've seen this coming for 10 years.     And this is before movies are made about Worldcom, and Martha, and Regis, and the list goes on.      How will Florida pay promised state employee retirement benefits to people living to 80 or 90 if returns on the retirement plan are only 6% for the next 10 years?   What will happen to sales taxes with cash balance plans cutting future pensions for many?     10 years ago, about 25% of retirees depended on social security for 90% or more of their income.  Based on  EBRI study quoted in AP story today, that figure is now 40%.    
 
CHECK OUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF INVESTORS IN THE FOLLOWING E-LETTER.    As I said, there are more investors than non-investors now.   Enough to elect a president.   I'll bet a lot of people who didn't even vote in recent years, given a president who supported ideas like executive escrow accounts, full dividend cuts, could get votes of previous non-voters.
 
AND WHILE HE'S GOING FOR THE END OF DOUBLE DIVIDEND TAX, WHY NOT DO A ROSS PEROT ON CORPORATE INCOME TAXES.   A SIMPLE CHART WILL SUFFICE.
 
Show how company has revenues, expenses, how to stay in business and pay employees they must make enough revenue to pay all expenses plus profit for shareholders.   Then show how taxes are part of expenses.  And how each dollar paid in taxes is included either in the price customer pays for product, or taken out of revenues that could pay higher wages.
 
COMPANIES DON'T PAY CORPORATE INCOME TAX, THEIR CUSTOMERS PAY IN HIGHER PRICES, OR EMPLOYEES IN LOWER WAGES.       Now consider comment from    "The Force of Finance".   KEY POINT :  FREE FLOW OF IDEAS AND CAPITAL KEY TO ECONOIMC GROWTH.   UNLESS CAPITAL CAN FLOW TO ENTREPRENURS, ECONOMIES WILL STAY BACKWARD.   aND ITS NOT JUST COMMERCE THAT IS LOST.   Human capital / ideas, flow out of countries where they are punished for success and to countries where they can maximize their PERSONAL return.    
 
For now, congress may have slowed exodus of existing US companies moving HQ to Bermuda, but from what I read, new companies are avoiding the mess by incorporating overseas to start.   and as a tech spokesman said, we can move the profits, or the profits and jobs.....     
 
I'm not an economist, but I think I have a lot of common sense, and a strong historical perspective from reading many  books on the subject besides Atlas Shrugged..........."The new barbarian manifesto" and "wealth and democracy" are just two.    
 
TRUST HAS BEEN BROKEN.    ELMERS GLUE WON'T BE ENOUGH TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE.  WE NEED SUPERGLUE OF VERY VERY PRO INVESTOR POLICIES.    
 
i HOPE YOU WILL MAKE TIME TO READ THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE.    IT COULD SHOW THE PATH TO THE POT OF GOLD HIDING BEHIND THE RAINSTORM OF CORRUPTION, DISHONESTY, SOCIALISM AND DISTRUST.

The Millennium Wave Investor E-Letter
Collectivized Risks
by John Mauldin 
January 3, 2003 



Introduction
Collectivized Risks with Bill Bonner
Vacation Update





This week we are in for a very special edition of the Millennium Wave Online. I have persuaded my good friend Bill Bonner of Daily Reckoning fame to give us a special preview of his new book "The Soft Depression of the 21st Century: How to Survive the Crisis of Degenerate, Mass Capitalism," (working title) due out in September. In it, he and fellow Daily Reckoneer Addison Wiggin, argue that popular democracy, aging populations and bad economic theories doom the US and other Western economies to follow the Japanese model, with recession, bear markets and failing consumer spending over the next 10 to 15 years. (Heavy stuff, I know... ) 

I read The Daily Reckoning almost every day. It's part of my morning ritual. In fact, I wrote to Bill last year to tell him that there are times when I feel like a house painter in front of a Rembrandt as I read his commentary. He is that good. In the following essay - which he tells me will comprise a portion of the finished book - he takes issue with economist Paul Krugman's position that America's current economic malaise has been caused by a return to pre-Depression free-market capitalism. "Au contraire," says Bonner, "today's markets with their collectivized risks are anything BUT the capitalism enjoyed by the world's capitalists prior to the 20th century." 

It's a strong read, worth your time and I hope you'll enjoy it. 

After the essay, I will show you how to get The Daily Reckoning for free - no strings attached. Now, let's see what Bonner and crew have worked up for us: 

******** 

COLLECTIVIZED RISKS by Bill Bonner 

Few popular economists have written as much about Japan's troubles as Princeton professor Paul Krugman. His views appear regularly in the New York Times and other media. 

"Here is a hypothesis," he suggests, offering an explanation for the strange events of the last 12 years, "the world became vulnerable to its current travails, not because economic policies had not be reformed, but because they had. That is, around the world, countries responded to the very real flaws in the policy regimes that had evolved in response to the Depression by moving back toward a regime with many of the virtues of pre-Depression, free-market capitalism. However, in bringing back the virtues of old- fashioned capitalism we also brought back some of its vices, most notably a vulnerability both to instability and to sustained economic slumps." 

Krugman imagines a kind of social contract after the Great Depression in which voters agreed to tolerate capitalism, but only with safety nets and regulations to make sure no one got hurt. In his mind only, these restraints produced a stable prosperity in which the benefits were shared out among the population during the '50s, '60s and '70s. 

"The America I grew up in -- the America of the 1950's and 1960s," he says, "was a middle class society. Yes, of course, there were still some rich people, he admits, but [thank God!] "there weren't that many of them. The days when plutocrats were a force to be reckoning with in American society, economically or politically, seemed long past." 

Krugman was writing to an appreciative audience in the NY Times magazine in October of 2002. Typically, he then lets himself get distracted, worrying that the rich may be making a comeback. The nation's top 100 CEO's compensation rose from an average of just $1.3 million in 1970 (in 1998 dollars) to $37.5 million in 2000. There are not enough of these super-rich to fill a zoning department in a mid-sized town, yet Krugman is so indignant about it he misses the important point altogether: the triumph of laissez-faire capitalism, which conservatives celebrate and Krugman rues, was a sham.

Wall Street's loss is your gain! 

The market lost 28.9% over the last 6 months. But Dennis Slothower's "Stealth Stocks" -- companies overlooked by Wall Street and the media -- returned profits of 44.67% ... 49.29%... 52.89% ... 93.01% ... 111.71% ... even 258.13%. "My Stealth Stocks don't make news," explains Dennis. "They just make money."

By the close of the 20th century, true capitalists had almost disappeared from the face of the earth. "Capitalism," was a pejorative term invented by Marx to describe a system in which the rich owned the means of production and exploited the masses. The system Marx described never really existed the way Marx imagined, though a casual observer with a chip on his should may have been tempted to see it that way. Marx then made a prediction: that the inevitable grind of history would put the means of production in the workers' hands and cut out the capitalists. 

Marx's economics were as fanciful as his history. But at least one of his predictions proved correct - though not at all in the way he thought. As the champagne glasses were hoisted and the new millennium rung in, it was the Marxist vision that had triumphed, not the laissez-faire vision of Smith and Turgot; the means of production were owned by the workers. (Curiously, the most laissez-faire economy in the world in 2001 was in Hong Kong -- a city under the direct control of still-communist China.) 

Even the very rich CEO's that galled Krugman were only hired guns - not genuine capitalists. Their extravagant pay levels was testimony not to the victory of raw capitalism, but to its defeat. Real capitalists would never allow managers to take so much of THEIR money. 

Modern corporations are owned by small shareholders, not big ones - usually through collectivized holdings in pension funds, mutual funds and so forth. These small holders have neither the gumption, power nor the incentive to resist absurdly high executive salaries. Even CEOs of companies whose earnings were falling - or who were approaching bankruptcy - were paid as if they were star quarterbacks in the super-bowl. 

Maybe they were especially talented and maybe they weren't. But the mere fact that they are paid so much, and appeared on magazine covers, seemed to awe the little shareholders and impress the analysts. The great mob of investors takes up the stock of these celebrity managers with no serious thought about them - and too small an interest to justify serious investigation. 

Mass capitalism not only produced mass delusions, but also a new shareholder arithmetic. It may make sense for Warren Buffett to look carefully at executive compensation. As a substantial shareholder, much of the money that went to over-compensate key employees would have otherwise have gone to him. But the two or three cents a small stockholder might have at stake makes serious investigation not worth the trouble. 

Still Krugman is so outraged he doesn't even notice. The nature of capitalism changed dramatically in the 20th century. In America and Japan, free-wheeling laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century gave way to a consensual, collectivized, capitalism of the 20th century -- a Kapitalismus Leicht, with massive state involvement and mass participation by people who wouldn't know a balance sheet from a bed pan. 

Capitalism in America was not the same after the Roosevelt Administration finished with it. But this was merely part of the bigger trend - toward a capitalism directed by government for its own purposes...and for the interests of government's beneficiaries. Share ownership became increasing widespread. In America by the end of the century enough people owned shares to elect a president. Share ownership rose from under 5% of the population at the beginning of the 20th century to fully 56% at its end. 

Like any large group of people removed from the facts or from direct experience, shareholders were as subject to mass emotions as a group of football fans or a lynch mob. With only 'public' knowledge to go by, they could be readily whipped up by the financial media, and were ready to amplify any fad to the point of absurdity. 

The first large movement of mass capitalism took place in America in the 20s. Share ownership was uncommon in 1900. There were only about 4000 stockbrokers in the whole country. Thirty years later, the number of brokers had increased more than 500%. Stocks became such a popular subject that even shoe-shine boys had an opinion on them. The Dow shot up from 120 on the first day of business in 1925 to 381 at the peak in '29.

Then, after the bubble burst, America experienced its first bout of mass- depression. Unlike previous busts, the '30s brought suffering to the entire nation, not just a handful of rich capitalists. A quarter of the workforce lost its jobs. In '31 and '32 more than 5,000 banks failed. The bear market on Wall Street dragged on and on...with the Dow not returning to its '29 high until 1954. 

For the first time too, voters demanded that their government 'do something'! The Roosevelt Administration did something, of course. It rushed to the scene with a program of monetary and fiscal stimulus, following the most recent fads in macro-economics. Never before had such forceful intervention been attempted. And never before was an economy so unimpressed. Instead of bouncing back as it had following the Panic of 1873 or the Bust of 1907, the nation lay down in a gutter of recession, bankruptcy and sluggish growth. - and stayed there for the next decade. Even then, it seemed to take the biggest war in world history to pry the poor fellow up again. 

"Too little, too late," was the professional opinion of the leading economists. Government had made a good attempt - but not massive enough, or fast enough. 

Another interpretation, out of step with the fashions of the day, was that the government's own efforts to help the economy out of its funk had actually made the situation worse - by stretching out the painful readjustments that needed to be made over a long period of time and at much greater cost. 

Either way, it was a New Era in capitalism. For now, government - often acting through its bureaucrats at the Federal Reserve - promised to soften capitalism's rough edges; to put into place safety nets that would protect people from serious injury, on or off the job, and to manage the nation's monetary and fiscal policies so as to ease the pain of the downward slope of the business cycle. Henceforth, budget deficits would become an economic tool, and not merely a convenience for pusillanimous politicians, unwilling to raise taxes to pay for their programs. And henceforth, interest rates would not be determined by the market, based on the supply of savings and the demand for it. Instead, interest rates - at least at the short end of the interest-rate curve - would be set by the central bank for the good of the economy! 

Krugman believes that during the '80s a neo-conservative push to "deregulate" loosed the capitalist dogs from their leashes while also reducing inflation levels in most developed countries. This return to pre-Depression policies inevitability led to Depression-era economies, he thinks, which explains Japan in the '90s - and America in the early 00s. 

If anyone can figure out how the shallow deregulations in '80s America produced the long malaise in '90s Japan, he is not working on this book [sic]. Capitalism was adopted by the Japanese following the war - almost grudgingly. But Japan's collective capitalism never bore much resemblance to the raw capitalism of Krugman's imagination. And even in America, the Reagan-era reforms hardly changed the nature of late-20th century capitalism. Barely a single thread in the massive public safety net was unraveled. 

Government spending went up by every measure -- as a percentage of personal income, in nominal dollars and in real ones. The fundamental trend towards mass, collective capitalism accelerated. By the end of the century fully half of all American households were little pseudo-capitalists. And of them, nearly half counted the majority of their wealth in the form of shares in public companies! 

By the end of the century, America had become the Shareholder Nation - every bit as obsessed with stock prices as Japan had been ten years earlier. Risk has been collectivized - so that hardly anyone feels immune from slump. Investors have lost money. Salarymen have lost (will lose) their jobs - almost unthinkable in Japan. And the government, too, has lost revenue. 

Scarcely noticed by economists of any persuasion was the way in which government became a partner in the managed, risk-averse capitalist systems of the late 20th century. By fits and starts, governments throughout the developed world have increased their share of GDP during the entire century. 

In short, government is no longer a spectator. It has become the biggest participant in the, supposedly, free markets of the western world. It has become the biggest spender in consumer economies... and the biggest borrower. It controls money and credit. It is the watchdog on the capital markets, its chief observer, and its chief beneficiary. 

In America, following the collapse of the stock market bubble in 2000, the effects were visible almost immediately on government budgets at ever level. In Japan, the nation's budget went from a surplus of 2.9% of GDP in 1991 to a deficit of 4.3% in 1996, as interest came down. 

In Japan, as in America, neither the government nor the central bank could sit by idly as the wealth and economic power of the Japanese imploded. Instead, they took the action Krugman and others urged on them - and made the situation worse.

Dear Governor, 

      As you may know, I now work with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians.  To me, they are the first environmentalists and the only people who actually live in the Everglades.  They are very much about doing the right thing for the Everglades no matter what the neoenvironmentalists think. I am confident that they will stand beside you if you take the tough stands necessary to move the restoration forward. The Tribe has  also enlisted the support of many Lake Okeechobee people in their efforts to move Mod Waters forward. I am sure that you are acquainted with Gail Powers of the Lake Okeechobee Business Owners (LOBO).  We are all concerned that if we don't move things visibly forward soon on Mod Waters, that we will lose both public and Congressional support for our efforts. I am confident that together we can move things forward.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you in support of Child In Need of Services/Family In 
Need of Services program funding.  The crisis/runaway shelter and 
counseling services that our local CINS/FINS provider (Youth and 
Family Alternatives) offers, is an invaluable resource to children in 
our community and to our school system.

FYA offers a safe shelter for teens who have runaway from home or are 
in the midst of a crisis at home.  Additionally, YFA assists the 
schools in Pasco County by providing counseling and case management 
services to some of our most "hard to reach" students - those who are 
truant from school or exhibit ungovernable behavior.

Please strongly consider increasing funding to these much needed 
services.  Without this CINS/FINS provider in my county, I would 
likely spend much more time doing paperwork and attending court 
hearings, and less time providing direct services to children and 
families.

Governor Jeb Bush
PL05 The Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, FL
 
Dear Governor Bush:
 
Warmest greetings for a bright and prosperous New Year for you and your family.
 
I write to inform you of a recent and significant activity that took place in Trinidad and Tobago. The non-profit organisation I represent, the Caribbean Network for Integrated Rural Development (CNIRD), having been the Regional Secretariat for the United Nations International Year of Volunteers (IYV) 2001, has now embarked on a follow-up project to establish a Volunteer Centre in Trinidad and Tobago.
 
To this end, we contacted the Florida Association of Voluntary Agencies for Caribbean Action (FAVA/CA) for their assistance in sourcing facilitators to conduct a workshop with leaders of volunteer agencies towards the establishment of a Volunteer Centre.
 
We soon received correspondence from Ms. Natasha Marks, FAVA/CA's International Programs Coordinator, informing us that the search for facilitators would begin soon. That was in September of 2002.
 
By early November 2002, we were well underway with preparations for the workshop, which was held on 4 and 5 December 2002. December 5 held special significance as it is recognized worldwide as the International Volunteer Day.
 
Three competent and professionals facilitated the two-day workshop - Dr. Jill Canono and Ms. Amieko Watson of Volunteer Florida and Ms. Carol Hodnett of Martin Volunteer Resource Centre. With a small group of 15 NGO leaders, we were taken though the conceptual steps of creating a mission statement, defining the services it would provide and some fundamentals of volunteer management.
 
All the participants gave glowing praise to the three women, who came well prepared and led the group through a had but exciting session. Many complained that two days was not enough!
 
Since then however, the core group of participants has met once and further discussed the next steps. It was decided that CNIRD would serve and the Secretariat for the Centre for the year 2003, while the necessary structures, funding and other support were determined. Our target is 5 December 2003, when we will officially launch the Volunteer Centre, in its own space and with its own staff.
 
Given CNIRD's regional mandate and in the spirit of Caribbean unity, strength and prosperity, the Volunteer Centre concept is one that in time we will spread throughout the region.
 
We are therefore pleased to tell you of the effective collaboration and cooperation between Florida and Trinidad and Tobago and we look forward to further successful relationships between our two countries.
 
 
Sincerely

Dear Jeb,
 
Regarding the class size amendment that the people foolishly passed:   
 
First I would like to tell you who I am.  I am a lifelong Republican and have served on the Broward Republican Executive Committee since 1991.  I have followed education issues in Florida since I moved here in 1973.  All four of my children went to public schools here in Plantation.  I continued to study education issues when I worked for Senator Jim Scott for six years, and more recently as I worked for Rep. Bill Andrews for the past eight years.  
On the amendment, I would like to join any effort to get it repealed.  Second, if the amendment is going to be implemented, I believe that decisions about how money is spent should be taken out of the hands of the school boards.  I know the trend has been to provide more local control, however, there has been little or no accountability for school boards that fritter away money on consultants, shoddy construction work, and promoting the agenda of the National Education Association and the local teachers’ unions.  Third, while the teachers’ union is publicly making “nice” with you and other Republican legislators, they continue to undermine education reform measures, and because school board members rely heavily on the unions to get elected and re-elected, they pretty much call the shots on local policies. 
 
Below are listed just a few of the things going on in South Florida:
 
1.	Legislation passed over a year ago – your bill that required school districts to give full credit for years of service – designed as an incentive for teachers to come to Florida is being undermined by the teachers’ union:  They negotiated a ten year cap on credit for service – this is their way of discouraging teachers from moving from one district to another and protecting seniority.  In spite of a memo sent out by the Department of Education, David Ashburn, school districts are not complying with the law.  They insist that this measure does not take effect until January 7, 2003, where the School Code rewrite specifically removes the issue from the collective bargaining table.  (I am told that this was a topic of discussion at the recent school boards’ meeting in Orlando, so it is obviously going on elsewhere too).
 
2.	In Broward County:  Although the school district employs people to keep track of student capacity, they haves hired consultants for $1.5 million to evaluate the district’s capacity and project future needs.  As a taxpayer I can only wonder if the district staff cannot do the job, why do those people remain on the payroll?    
 
3.	Miami-Dade:  In 1997, we discovered that the school district was spending 66% of their 2 mil dollars (specified for capital outlay) on salaries and disposable items.  Currently they have an oversight committee that must okay spending.  This happened due to the district buying untested and uninspected land – not to mention a plethora of contracts that have been awarded without bids.  (It’s not just the school district that is corrupt – the former airport manager and his wife go on trial next month for accepting bribes).  
 
4.	Palm Beach County – In a convoluted land swap deal, the City of Delray Beach is buying land and pushing people out of their homes to relocate a high school from a neighborhood that wants it to remain, to a location where senior citizens oppose it.  The current location is among the highest elevations in Palm Beach County, and there are several buildings on it that were built or renovated within the last five years.  If the school is relocated, not only will existing buildings be abandoned, they will be rebuilt at the new location (which the school board rejected at least twice as unsuitable).  Professional architects estimate that the cost of building on the new site will be between $5 million and $20 million more than rebuilding on the current site, retaining the sound buildings. (You have been receiving petitions and correspondence opposing this move of Atlantic High School).  In addition to the higher cost (which could be used to build other schools) students traveling on foot will have to navigate on and off ramps of I-95, a railroad track, a cement plant, and an intersection that ranks sixth in Palm Beach County for accidents.  
 
The public is constantly being told (through the teachers’ union) that the Legislature does not adequately fund education.  The truth is, the school districts are not held accountable for the way they spend it.  The few times that they are “caught” spending inappropriately, they pay the fine with current dollars – taking it from the classroom.  This hurts the kids, and certainly does not change their behavior.  
 
Many say that accountability for school board members comes at the ballot box.  That may be true in some instances, but too often the public keeps re-electing board members because they are not informed of their true records, or they have given up trying to change the entrenched bureaucracy.    In the last election in Palm Beach County, a political unknown ran against the chairman of the school board because he is the driver of the above land swap.   She was able to garner 44% of the vote in the short time between filing and the election.  But, because of new school board member districts, the people who will be most affected by the deal could not vote because they do not live in the district.  
 
I hope you will use this information as a springboard for changing the system.   Without changing the current system, a lot of children will continue to be left behind.

Subject: Universal E-mail Connectivity Initiative


Jeb,
 
As I mentioned at the end of the State Technology Office Transition Team meeting last week, I recommend that the State of Florida provide its citizens with permanent e-mail addresses.  The state and its people would benefit tremendously from universal, reliable, life-long e-mail connectivity.  As I'll outline below, there's a need for it, and it will greatly accelerate adoption of your vision for how technology will change the way the people relate to the government and the government to the people.
 
*	Universal E-mail Connectivity is Needed in Florida (and Everywhere Else) 
 
*	E-mail addresses now are unreliable and unsuitable for the personal needs of most of Florida's citizens - they are a function of e-mail users' non-permanent relationships with e-mail service providers, who generally fall into one of three categories: 
 
*	Employers, who terminate the e-mail account when the employee is no longer employed, and who often limit usage of the account to the employer's official business 
 
*	Internet service providers, whose e-mail service is lost when the subscriber terminates or changes his/her ISP service, and 
 
*	Internet portals such as Yahoo, who generally provide basic e-mail service that is free, but that comes with significant unattractive features, such as 
 
*	Relatively modest maximum file storage limitations unless the user pays for enhanced service 
 
*	Limited available names and idiosyncratic naming conventions that result in e-mail addresses such as jebb55049@yahoo.com, which don't present a professional impression to e-mail recipients, and therefore make the use of such e-mail services less helpful for some purposes such as job hunting 
 
*	Unreliable service - portal-sponsored e-mail addresses sometimes stop working for no apparent reason, without any real hope of getting service restored 
 
*	Inclusion of branding messages or advertisements at the bottom of every outgoing e-mail (e.g., "Do you Yahoo?") 
 
*	Because their e-mail accounts aren't permanent and/or reliable, most people would not choose to let government agencies or businesses send them important communications via e-mail 
 
*	If they were receiving vital correspondence via e-mail, termination of their e-mail account would expose them to a risk of not getting some important messages, and require them to notify dozens of government agencies, businesses and other parties of the change 
 
*	The economically underprivileged would especially benefit from a permanent e-mail address - see the Miami Herald article at this link: 
http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/local/states/florida/counties/broward_county/4797915.htm
 
 
*	Universal E-mail Connectivity Would Accelerate Implementation of Your Vision for a More Efficient, Citizen-Sponsored State Government 
 
*	A permanent, reliable, e-mail account would provide the impetus many Floridians need to switch over to receiving important correspondence, such as notices of license renewals, vehicle registrations, property appraisals, tax bills, etc., via e-mail, thereby saving substantial mailing costs 
 
*	If citizens receive communications from government agencies via e-mail, they will be much more likely to use the state portal for the purposes you envision 
 
*	Encounters such as a drivers license renewals are more likely to be completed online if they start online through e-mail-based renewal notices that include a link to the portal site at which drivers licenses may be renewed, and instructions for electronic renewal 
 
*	Similarly, citizens will be more likely to read helpful, relevant information found on the state portal if they are made aware of it via e-mail that includes a link to that information 
 
*	The more transactions that are conducted online through the portal, the more it will spawn even more portal awareness and usage 
 
*	Although we can envision many wonderful uses of universal e-mail connectivity, I 'm convinced that many of the best uses are beyond our imagination right now, and will be identified only after the system is implemented 
 
*	The Challenges are Relatively Modest 
 
*	Spam - could be handled through a no-call list like phone solicitations, or through spam filters that are in use now by e-mail service providers 
 
*	Hacking/viruses/information security - handled the same way as e-mail security is handled by e-mail service providers now 
 
*	Cost - the cost of the equipment and telecom services needed to provide e-mail service is falling; fixed costs of equipment and infrastructure would be spread over so many subscribers that the average cost per account would be very small, and the marginal cost of adding one more e-mail account would be infinitesimal 
 
*	The State could recover much of the cost in savings of paper, handling and postage from e-mailing rather than physical delivery of correspondence with citizens 
 
*	It would be nice to get all of the state, local and federal government agencies and businesses who use the state e-mail platform to pay for that privilege - maybe offer some enhanced services to sending agencies such as electronic return receipts for a fee 
 
*	for state and local governments within Florida, the Legislature could mandate giving Floridians a choice as to whether to receive official correspondence electronically via their Florida e-mail account, and require a small "click charge" be paid by the sending agency to the State's e-mail fund for every e-mail communication 
 
*	Status of e-mail account when people move out of Florida 
 
*	The state could terminate the account, or make former residents pay to keep it active, but I recommend letting our "citizens emeritus" keep their accounts without charge 
 
*	The marginal cost of providing the e-mail address is low, and the cost of enforcing a "citizens only" rule is high 
 
*	It's good branding for the state and its technology vision for a former Floridian living in Virginia to be using his/her Florida e-mail address 
 
*	Other states may follow Florida's lead in offering e-mail service, and Florida would benefit from the use of other state-provided e-mail accounts retained by people who move to Florida 
 
*	Universal e-mail addresses would drive Internet access and usage, especially for the underprivileged, chipping away at the digital divide issue 
 
*	In addition to public libraries, we'd see Internet kiosks at many more places accessible by the underprivileged 
 
*	Other citizens generally already have adequate Internet access at work and at home 
 
With universal e-mail accounts for life, Florida could lead the nation in providing its citizens something that is inexpensive to provide, but very useful for its citizens, and efficient for state government operations as well.  Please let me know what I can do to help you evaluate this idea, and implement it if you decide to move forward on it.
 
Thanks again for allowing me to serve on the Transition Team, and giving me the chance to provide input on ways to realize your technology vision.
 
Best regards,
Michael

Honorable Legislator.
 
This follows my previous e-mail. By the way, as you are aware there  is no need for allocation of taxpayers monies since all condo owners pay a door fee of $4.00 per unit per year for a total present budget of approximately $7,000,000. Dollars pay to the Division of Condominiums with no  positive results, the money is practically wasted on bureaucracy claiming that have all kinds of statutory limitations. As you may also know the average price of a single family home in Dade County today is $212,000 which means that the majority of the families do not qualify therefore leaving no other choice but to purchase a condominium making the sistuation worse by day. Please act now.

Dear Governor Bush: 

I am writing to direct your attention to a proposed contract the FWC is currently negotiating with the Central Bank of Missouri.  First, allow me to introduce you to eAngler.com.  eAngler is a technology company, located in Tampa, Florida, that caters to anglers of all types.  We primarily sell fishing tackle online throughout the US and internationally, with a large portion of our sales to residents of Florida.  In addition to fishing tackle, we sell Florida fishing and hunting licenses through a contract awarded by the FWC in May of 2000.  We have sold over 61,000 licenses since we began selling in October 2000 and that number has been growing 100% annually.

In July of 2001, I participated as a speaker at your IT Town meeting held in Tampa.  The purpose of the IT Town meetings was to promote/attract technology companies to Florida.   This is the reason I am writing.  The FWC issued an "Invitation to Negotiate" in August of 2002 to invite companies to propose on providing an automated point of sale system for the sale of fishing and hunting licenses.  The ITN also covers the consolidation of telephonic and internet sales of licenses along with the point of sales.  Three companies submitted their qualifications and two were disqualified, leaving the FWC to negotiate with the Central Bank of Missouri.  eAngler partnered with one of the disqualified parties.  The Central Bank of Missouri will charge residents of Florida and nonresidents, who wish to enjoy one of the great resources of this State, $2.25 per license.  This represents a 15.4% increase in the cost of purchasing a license online compared to eAngler's $1.95 per license.    

The initial term of our contract with the FWC will expire this May.  Our contract has a provision for 3 one-year extensions.  By all accounts at the FWC, we have exceeded their expectations and when we have been asked to participate in other efforts of the FWC, such as supporting the Florida Bass Conservation Center and the Florida Big Catch program, we have gladly agreed.  It is my opinion that entering into a contract with the Central Bank of Missouri is inconsistent with the stated objective to attract technology companies to Florida.

I am respectfully requesting your office contact Mr. Ken Haddid and Ms. Susan Weaver of the FWC to urge the FWC to consider extending eAngler's contract for the remaining 3 year extension period as a show of support for one of Florida's technology companies.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. 

Respectfully, 

Michael B. Davis

I have known Irene for more than 15 years and know her to be very intelligent, organized and honest.  She has never dropped the ball on anything.  She takes on tasks big and small and get them done and done right.  Her integrity is beyond reproach.  Ms. Iorio has done a terrific job during her tenure but I know that you and the voters of Hillsborough County will not be disappointed in Irene Guy.

Good Morning:

The Father's rights were terminated and accepted by the Judge. Second, the "Best Interest of the Child" hearing was acknowledged by the Court as well.

DCF tried several times to object to the fact that the child is in our home for subsequent adoption proceedings....The Judge basically said that they have no basis for their objection. The Mother's rights have been terminated (by her choice and free will) and the Judge acknowledged and accepted them as well.

DCF said they plan on appealing this case for as long as it takes the Judge to realize that "they" neeed to place the child in a permanent home....They agreed that the child is doing well with us and "could" remain with us...."COULD."

Nevertheless, here is where it stands today. We have a 30 day wait period for the Father's right to appeal his termination.  Governor Bush her will not appeal....He was ont he phone from prision and stated that he definitely wants the baby's current custodians to adoption him!

Basicall, DCF wants to be the heros here....The baby is in a warm, loving and most of all safe environment....Isn't this the goal for DCF? Why are they costing the taxpayers so much time with frivilous appeals?

My next issue is with Children Home Society to approve our homestudy...They said that they have no problem with it, but because of the situation with me 8 years ago, DCF will not give me FDLE clearance....Governor Bush their were no convictions, probations or anything, just adjuducation withheld....Meanwhile, I have a private homestudy that was approved with flying colors.....

It would be nice to have this homestudy as well as we would like to adopt another child next year for Craig....

I don't know if you made any calls or helped with this mornings hearing, but if so, thank yiu from the bottom of my heart.......Once DCF is out of the picture, Bob and I will have  a beautiful baby boy to love and raise as our son!

Mr. Clark, 

Thank you for your response to my e-mail.  I appreciate all that has been done to help provide Emma Noelle with access to healthcare. 

I do realize that DCF does not handle changes in Medicaid providers; however, they do handle the information that is placed in the file.  Because of DCF's insistence on keeping the birth mother's name on the file even though they were informed several times that her parental rights were terminated, Emma's medicaid plan was changed without my knowledge and neither I nor my attorney were able to change it back to the original plan.  It took me nearly two months, repeated phone calls to a line that consistently rang busy, and when calls did get answered I was repeatedly told to call a different department.  I was also repeatedly passed back and forth between AHCA and DCF.  DCF forwarded me to four different departments until I finally asked for the name and telephone number of the acting local director whom I called twice, call never returned.  In the midst of all of this I was told by someone at DCF that this baby was not even mine and that I did not have custody of her.  Yes, I have worked with Gilda Ferradaz on this situation, but only after numerous phone calls back and forth between AHCA and DCF.  Someone at DCF gave me Ms. Ferradaz's name and number and specific instructions on what I needed to tell her to do to get the plan switched, which included taking the birth mother's name off of the file and putting my attorney's name on.  I faxed Ms. Ferradaz all of the adoption related documents I have and the name was finally changed on the file.  (Again, please keep in mind that I attempted to provide DCF with the adoption information and my attorney's name and phone number in June.  Actually, my first e-mail to Governor Bush was in late June to request help with extending Emma's medicaid until the adoption because both my attorney and I were told by DCF that it could not be extended.  Even after my e-mail I was told by DCF that they could not extend it because Emma did not have a social security number or birth certificate.  I said if necessary I would e-mail the Governor again, and only then was it extended; however, they kept the birth mother's name on the file even though I repeatedly offered to provide documents indicating that she had already signed to terminate her parental rights.)  Ms. Ferradaz called to inform me that it was taken care of and that I could call Doris Rivera to follow-up.  I called Ms. Rivera on December 12.  I was told that the change back to the original plan would take effect January 1, 2003.  I was told that until then I would have to take Emma to a clinic in Naranja.  I explained that Naranja was approximatey one hour from my home.  I also explained that Emma had a heart problem that required a follow-up visit.  I was told I had to take her to the clinic in Naranja to get a referral.  I questioned when and why the change occurred without my knowledge.  Ms. Rivera explained that the birth mother was notified of the change.  I asked how the birth mother could be notified when her parental rights had been terminated.  (Please note:  Ms. Rivera used to work for DCF and was the person I initially dealt with in June.)  Ms. Rivera then said that they were waiting on documents from me and would have changed the name in June if I would have provided the documents.  Of course I became upset because I tried so hard to give DCF the documents and the attorney's contact information in June.  Even my attorney attempted to call DCF.   I then decided to e-mail Governor Bush to request assistance, and to make him aware of an appalling situation.  I am glad I did e-mail him because I was in for another surprise!  I recieved an urgent call from Lydia Cardelle on December 23, 2002.  She said she had just received the information from Gilda Ferradaz that very day and it would be taken care of and that it would be effective FEBRUARY 1, 2003!  I asked her how that could be because I was told by Doris Rivera that it was effective January 1, 2003.  She said that Gilda Ferradaz did not give her the information until December 23, and if she had it by December 17 she could have processed it for January 1, 2003.  I was also initially told by her that I may be financially responsible for the doctor visits from October - December.  After a lengthy discussion I was told that the doctor will have to absorb the costs and that I could continue to see the regular pediatrician as long as the pediatrician's office requested a waiver prior to the visit.  On December 26 I received Emma's new medicaid card from my attorney.  I thought it was a little too quick for the attorney to receive the card from the medicaid office and forward it to me, when I had just spoken to Lydia Cardelle on December 23.  I decided to check the date I e-mailed Governor Bush and discovered it was on December 12, the same day I spoke with Doris Rivera.  I then called Ms. Cardelle back again and asked her to please double check the date Emma's plan would become effective.  She again confirmed that it would not be effective until February 1, 2003.  I then asked her if Doris Rivera worked for the Medicaid office.  She confirmed.  I told her that I already received Emma's new card from my attorney, and that I spoke to Doris Rivera on December 12.  I then reminded her that she told me they could have made the switch effective January 1, 2003 if they had been provided the information by Gilda Ferradaz by December 17.  I told her receipt of Emma's new card and my e-mail to Governor Bush documented my telephone conversation with Doris Rivera at the Medicaid office as December 12; therefore, all blame should not be placed on Gilda Ferradaz and DCF.  She told me there was no problem because even though the plan will not be effective until February 1, 2003, I can still take her to my pediatrician as long as a waiver is requested. 

I am happy to know that I can now continue to take Emma to her regular pediatrician.  Unfortunately, I am shocked to find out that after everything I had been through and was told throughout the two months, the plan had never actually been switched back to the original medipass plan.  And I would not have even known it if not for my e-mail to Governor Bush.   

I apologize for the length of this letter, but I feel it is important to make you aware of this situation, not for me, but for the people who may experience similar frustrations but lack skills to help themselves or their children.  This situation has made me more aware of and sensitive to the challenges and frustrations of the less fortunate in our community.  As an educator I used to wonder why my students would miss an entire day or even two days just to go to a doctor's appointment.  (Growing up my mother made our appointments either early in the morning or late in the afternoon so we would only miss half the school day.)  I also did not understand why my students did not go to see a doctor for certain illnesses or injuries when medical attention was necessary.  I now understand that even though they had medicaid, it still was a very frustrating and lengthy process.    

Please understand that I do not blame anyone for this situation; however, I suspect that my situation is not unique.   I hope you recognize that there were numerous problems throughout the entire process so that the problems can be corrected and not replicated.    

Again, thank you for you help. 
Have a nice day!

Dear Governor:

I'm sure you don't remember the many times we've met, but my name is Jacqui Knight.  Recently, I ran as the Republican candidate for Hillsborough County Commission against Thomas Scott (D).  With less than 6 months, and less than $10,000, I managed to take 30% of the vote from a 6-year incumbent who raised nearly $80,000.

For more than 24 years, I have been a professional in public, government and community relations as well as an advertising designer.  In fact, several years ago, I designed ads for the Florida GOP aimed at the minority media.  For seventeen years, I have been a journalist, and as a ghostwriter have written for some of the largest pastorates in the nation.

Two years ago, I founded a non-profit program called Operation: Open Hearts.  We provide emergency repair and rehab to houses owned by elderly and disabled citizens.

I bring all this to say that I understand grassroots politics.  I understand Hillsborough County.  And as an African American, I understand both the Black and Hispanic Communities.  I grew up in a largely upper middleclass, predominately Jewish suburb of Chicago.  I am a musician and an athlete.  I am well traveled, well read, and well educated.

And further, I am interested in being your appointee to the Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections Office.

I am a member in good standing of the Republican Executive Committee, and have been and will remain a loyal republican.   I have attached my bio and my resume for your perusal.  I would appreciate your questions and your consideration for this post.

Thank you.

RE:  BROWARD COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD, FLORIDA vs. A.A.
       DOAH CASE. NO. 02-4772E
       
Dear Shan:

On August 20, 2002, you wrote a letter to Ms. Leah Kelly, Director, Exceptional Student Education, regarding my July 6, 2002 letter to you sent via electronic mail in which I addressed the Broward County School Board pattern and practice of "... denying the parents of students with disabilities the opportunity to receive a due process hearing in a timely manner due to the school district's use of a form response regarding the availability of alternative dispute resolution..."  In your letter to Ms. Leah Kelly, you clearly state, referring to the specific form used by the School Board of Broward County:  "...The second set of choices, above, seems to suggest that if the parents request state mediation, they must agree to waive the 45-day requirement for a due process hearing.  As you and I discussed, this is not consistent with the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Specifically, section 300.506(b)(1) of title 34 of the Federal Code of Regulations (Title 34) states, "The procedures must ensure that the mediation process-(i) Is voluntary on the part of the parties; (ii) Is not used to deny or delay a parent's right to a due process hearing under Sec. 300.507, or to deny any other rights afforded under Part B of the Act..." Thus, even if the parents agree to explore alternative dispute resolution procedures like mediation, they are still entitled to simultaneously pursue the due process hearing proceedings within the specified timeframe."  (Emphasis added).

As the forwarded message from Ms. Grace McDonald, Due Process Coordinator, from Broward County School Board clearly indicates, it seems that regardless of your August 20, 2002 letter and the fact that this is the law and has been the law for years, the Broward County School Board and its representatives, including the school board lawyer, continue their same pattern and practice denial of the due process rights that parents have under IDEA and under our state laws, specifically those indicated above under 34 C.F.R. 300.506 relative to mediation.

The Broward County School Board denied A.A. the related services of occupational therapy based on an evaluation conducted by an occupational therapist employed by the School Board.  The parents disagreed and requested either provision of the needed related services of OT for A.A. or an independent OT evaluation at public expense.  The School Board of Broward County denied both and the School Board, not the parents, filed a request for a due process hearing against A.A. to determine whether or not A.A. should be entitled to the independent OT evaluation at public expense requested by his parents.

Ms. Grace McDonald, Broward County School Board Due Process Coordinator, sent me the electronic message that I am forwarding to you in its entirety, which in part reads:

In a message dated 1/6/03 9:15:45 PM !!!First Boot!!!, mcdonald_grace@bcpsgw.broward.k12.fl.us writes:



Due to several other cases being scheduled during the month of Jan., Mr. Marko and I are available on the following dates, Jan. 24, Jan 27, and/or Feb 3, for state mediation. 
It is my understanding from an email you sent to Margot that the parents are interested in participating in State Mediation relative to this due process.  
It is further my understanding that the parents are not willing to waive the 45 days in order to participate in state mediation.  Since I believe the 45 days would be concluded on or about Jan. 29, it will not be possible for state mediation to occur without waiving the 45 days.
Please let me know by tomorrow whether the parents have changed their position regarding the waiving of the 45 days,  in an attempt to participate in state mediation.  If so, please indicate which of those three dates would be the most convenient so that I can notify Dr. Stetler.  

If I have not received written verification of the parents willingness to waive the 45 day requirement in order to participate in state mediation by tomorrow afternoon at 4:00, I will assume that we are going forward with the hearing on Jan. 15th.  I will then provide to the parents the documents we intend to introduce and the potential witnesses we may call on Jan. 8 as is required by law 5 days prior to the hearing.  (Emphasis added)



As an advocate on behalf of students with disabilities in Florida, I cannot say that I am surprised by the actions of the School Board of Broward County.  The State of Florida Department of Education has failed and continues to fail to hold any school district in Florida accountable for violations of the state and federal laws enacted to protect the rights of children with disabilities and their parents.  Rather than holding school districts accountable for continued violations, the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services enables school districts to continue to violate the law with complete disregard of the rights of children with disabilities and their parents.  The only enforcers of these laws in Florida are the parents themselves and with no enforcement tools available to them, their success is very limited.  However, we continue to trust that our beloved Governor's plan to reorganize the State of Florida Department of Education includes holding the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services accountable for its continued failure to uphold the law in Florida on behalf of children with disabilities and their parents, so that Florida stops leaving behind children with disabilities.  

Please communicate in writing no later than 4:00 P.M. today, as requested by Ms. McDonald, your intentions regarding A.A.'s right to participate in state mediation without using mediation to force the parents "to waive the 45 day requirement in order to participate in state mediation," which as you clearly indicated in your August 20, 2002 letter to Ms. Leah Kelly, is not "consistent with the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)," so as not to delay the due process hearing, which, in this case, has been initiated by the School Board of Broward County against A.A.

Subject:	The Broward County School Board vs. A.A. - DOAH Case No. 02-4772E

Dear Mr. Woodring,

I sent you a copy of my letter to Ms. Shan Goff regarding the due process hearing initiated by The Broward County School Board vs. A.A., DOAH Case No. 02-4772E. per our discussion during our recent meeting in Broward County with Berthy and Milton Aponte, Laura Prado, Michael Boswell, and Kim McDougal to discuss the proposed changes to ESE Rule 6A-6.03311 pertaining to due process rights, as a perfect example of the continued failure of the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services to hold school districts accountable, being this one of the issues that we discussed at length. 

In addition, as another example of another issue that we discussed during our meeting relative to the poor and inadequate training that the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services provides to Administrative Law Judges assigned to hear ESE due process cases, I want to bring to your attention that the ALJ assigned to the above mentioned case, ALJ Stuart Lerner, has cited Chapter 230.23 (4) (m), Florida Statutes; Rule 6A-6.03311; and Chapter 28-106, Parts I and II, Florida Administrative Code as the "authority" to conduct the ESE due process hearing in the Notice of Hearing entered in this case on December 23, 2002. 

As we all know and have discussed, Chapter 230.23(4)(m)5 of the Florida Statutes specifically exempts ESE due process hearings from Chapter 28-106, Parts I and II (see S.T. v. School Bd. of Seminole County, 783 So.2d 1231, Fla. App. 5 Dist. 2001).  What hope can parents of children with disabilities possibly have to access due process and to have hearings conducted in a "fair and impartial" manner when the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services continues to perpetuate these blatant violations of the most basic rights of children with disabilities and their parents?   Parents have to continue to be the enforcers of the law because the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services continues to fail to hold school districts accountable.  If the parents must be the enforcers of the law, then the parents need tools to access due process in a "fair and impartial" manner.  The first step must be that ALJs or hearing officers must be trained by an entity other than the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services on the special education laws enacted to protect the rights of children with disabilities and their parents so that due process hearings are necessary, they can be conducted in a "fair and impartial" manner.  

Mr. Woodring, as I have written before, "o

ur democracy is based on a system of laws that is supposed to be enforceable. It is designed so that attorneys will help to enforce those laws. When a group of people are cut off from having equal access to the legal system, we no longer have democracy."  I urge you and the Governor's team in charge of the reorganization of our Department of Education and the review of the proposed ESE rules that children with disabilities and their families be provided with the access to our democracy that they have been denied for so many years and that the necessary steps will be taken so that the Bureau may no longer be able to cut off children and parents from having equal access to our legal system.

Governor Bush,

 

I enjoyed having the opportunity to talk to you and Columba at the Christmas Party in your home. My husband Bob and I appreciated your hospitality. Your home is beautiful and it was a lovely evening. We regret that we are unable to be in Tallahassee for the inauguration, but are there in spirit.

 

As I mentioned at the Christmas Party (while breaking away from the topic of the concrete industry), Orange County Public Schools has been working very hard to make reading a key focus in our community. One of our newest efforts has been to partner with WKMG Channel 6 to video tape dignitaries reading a children's story. The segments will be aired in January/February. Our slogan "Reading is the Key" is becoming recognizable throughout the community.

 

We would love to arrange to have WKMG video tape you reading a children's book. We have selected books that are short in length for primary students. Please let me know if it would be possible to make the arrangements for this.

 

We are also working to create a partnership with our parents and caregivers to support them in the early years of parenting. I know that the family's role in education from birth to age five is also something which you have expressed an interest in and we would love to coordinate an interview with you on this topic. 

 

Once again, thank you for your hospitality. Bob and I believe in what you are doing for Florida and you may always count on our support. I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Mr. McDonough, et al,
 
I would like to thank you for allowing me to participate in the annual Governor's Drug Summit since 2001.  We have enjoyed the open dialogue and it has been a privilege to be part of the discussion on how Florida gets control over drugs.  As you know, we are not a well funded group of professional policy drivers.  Florida drug policy reform efforts come from ordinary voting American's who want to find real solutions for the crisis we have because of drugs.  Most of us see the effects of prohibition on our families and in our neighborhoods, then long for a better way.
 
I know you are a man of order and compassion.  Some friends of ours have worked together to create an on-line presentation of A Drug War Carol.  Dickens's Classic Tale is retold when the US Director of Drug Control orders the arrest of a medical cannabis using patient on Christmas.  www.adrugwarcarol.com is the link.  It is an excellent representation of the reasons I believe prohibition is not the answer.  I hope you will make some time to read the story.  The links are helpful and the art work is tremendous.
 
We would like to invite you to help us find a way to get real control over the problem of drugs in Florida.  On March 26, 2003 we have arranged for Judge James Gray to be at the University of Central Florida Orlando Campus.  He is working with a group of students with the local NORML Chapter and the UCF Progressive Council.  We would be honored to have you attend the meeting with Judge Gray.  Judge Gray's bio is below.  We are certain that by allowing you, panel members of your choice and Judge Gray to create a dialogue that we can find some innovative solutions.  We know that the citizens of Central Florida are anxious to support a forum of this nature.  We are certain that the media would cover such a debate.  Groups like NORML , the Progressive Council and Students for Sensible Drug Policy are forming on every campus.  They are ready to follow an innovative leader.
 
We hope you will help us choose a format for the forum that allows for questions and answers.  If you would like a several person panel, please let us know who you would like to be involved.  We realize your schedule is busy but we hope you will personally attend rather than send an associate.  The violence on the streets and the depression that is destroying teens lives can be managed with strong leadership.  
 
Again, we are not a group of well funded diplomats, we are residents of this state who want a safe place to live  As you know I am raising children in this state and I don't want to leave the legacy of problems we are facing to my children and your children's children.
 
Thank you for your consideration of our request.  You will find Judge Gray's bio below the banner.
 
I look forward to receiving my invitation to the summit shortly, the address remains the same as last year.

Bio of Judge James P. Gray as adapted from MPP/SSDP 2002 Conference Biographies
 
Cited on numerous occasions for his work in the areas of both social and civic philanthropy, Judge James P. Gray currently presides over the civil trial calendar for the Superior Court of Orange County.  Throughout his 25-year career within the legal and judicial community, Judge Gray has not only donated hundreds of hours of volunteer time to existing community service organizations, he also has created and implemented a number of innovative programs of his own, each one a success story in itself.  His efforts to stop the problem of drunk driving and to encourage children to stay in school have been particularly noteworthy.    
 
Although Judge Gray has championed many causes, none has been more bold than his work to combat the illegal drug problem in America.  Gray continues to mobilize civil leaders, government officials, corporation, non-profit organizations, the media, and the public across the country to join him in exploring alternative solutions to reduce this chronic problem.  
 
In addition to his ongoing civic activities and philanthropic work, Judge Gray has been an adjunct professor at Chapman University, the College of Trial Advocacy for new Orange County attorneys and the Continuing Legal Education of the Bar.

Governor Bush:

 

Thank you for the opportunity to assist you in developing a policy agenda as you begin your second term as Governor of Florida. As my policy expertise lies primarily in the field of education, I will offer a few brief observations and suggestions as you and your team begin your work.

 

Over the last four years, you and Lt. Governor Brogan have done tremendous work on behalf of Florida’s students and their families.  From creating new educational grants like the Opportunity and McKay scholarships to reorganizing the State Department of Education, your leadership made Florida a national leader in education reform, and especially in providing real parental choice in education.

 

I urge you to continue expanding school choice options by making it easier to create new charter schools. As you know, charter schools can be a driving force in helping our students, particularly those in academically at-risk schools, prepare to meet the challenges of the global economy, through use of rigorous, world-class academic content. 

 

Florida students could also benefit from expanded access to public virtual or cyber schools. Virtual schools can utilize powerful technology to deliver outstanding academic content to children regardless of where they live or what their educational needs might be. Expanding public virtual education will require lowering numerous barriers, including: revising charter school and/or open enrollment laws to allow for off-site education; ensuring adequate per pupil funding levels; and, maintaining a focus on achievement and academic outputs, rather than on burdensome regulations. In the interest of full disclosure, let me add that I helped found a company called K12, which provides a rigorous, research-based curriculum to virtual public schools in seven states.  Through test scores, parental satisfaction, and third party reviews, our schools are showing strong academic results and success.

 

Don’t stop holding educational leaders and schools of every type ­ whether traditional brick-and-mortar, charter, or virtual ­ accountable for academic performance and results. “Innovative” is not necessarily a synonym for “excellent,” and “traditional” is not always “outdated.”

 

Best wishes, we are proud of you, and grateful for you,

Gov. Bush,
 
I enjoyed your inaugural speech. However, I remain frustrated with your press office's inability to answer even the simplest questions in a timely and professional manner.
 
A request today for your children's accurate, updated ages took multiple calls to fulfill. I can't imagine a less demanding inquiry. However, instead of simply telling me the ages the first person I spoke with referred me to the Website (I was unable to locate the ages there even after an extensive search). The second person left me on hold for a while, even though I said I could not hold, and then guessed at the ages based upon the birth year. She only looked up the birth month at my insistence.
 
They wasted a lot of time for me on deadline on what should have been a routine question and answer and they were just plain sloppy. 
 
Now, I know you've had a difficult time with the press - although not with this reporter - but I can't see how anyone benefits from shoddy work like this. I am convinced it does a disservice to the office of governor, which I respect, and to you, who I also respect.
 
You should also know that upon my arrival here in September my courtesy call to the press office and suggestion that I  looked forward to working with them was received with outright skepticism, which is not an attitude a professional would express at that time. 
 
Furthermore, let me add that as an honorable person who takes pride in their work, I no more enjoy being treated like a suspect than you do.
 
Respectfully Yours,

Subject: New Mercury rise in Florida fish is bad for tourism $$$$$


Dear Governor Bush:  I hope that our State DEP can do something about the rise in mercury in Florida fish (see story below). Perhaps more regulations should be considered and restrictions on industrial waste products. This news could really hurt our economy in the tourism sector.
--------------------------------------------------------------



More fish added to state's advisory list on dangerous mercury

Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel
Staff and wire reports 
Posted January 7 2003 

Biologists have asked state health officials to add several marine fish species to a forthcoming health advisory that warns Floridians about eating mercury-tainted fish.

The state is finishing the wording on the advisory and could make brochures available to the public as early as next month, said Bill Parezik, a Health Department spokesman.
Researchers at the Florida Marine Research Institute have called for limiting consumption of cobia, little tunny, blue fish and crevalle jack.

They also have found data suggesting another fish, greater amber jack, should be added to the list, said George Henderson, a senior scientist with the Florida Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg.

The list of freshwater Florida fish covered by consumption warnings won't grow with the new advisories, said Scott Hardin, a fisheries official for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

But he said the state may change its location-by-location listing of mercury warnings for three freshwater species -- largemouth bass, gar and bowfin. The warning for all three probably will be extended statewide because of new mercury findings. Areas where it is clearly safe to eat those fish will be listed as exemptions to the blanket warning.

Levels of mercury in marine fish in Florida have remained stable in recent years, Henderson said.

In the Everglades, where some of the highest mercury readings once occurred, levels are dropping in large predatory fish, Hardin said.

"Mercury is heading downward in the Everglades, where we had the most difficult levels," he said.

Levels in Everglades fish that once warranted warnings against any consumption have dropped to levels permitting limited consumption, Hardin said.

Environmental officials attribute the improvement to regulations on mercury burned in municipal and medical waste incinerators in South Florida.

Since 1989, the state has issued public health advisories warning about the potential risk from fish taken from various waterways. The last advisory was issued in 1997.

Mercury in large enough doses can damage the human nervous system and harm the development of fetuses. Women of childbearing age and children younger than 10 should not eat more than 8 ounces of the fish on the list in a month, and everyone else should not eat more than 8 ounces a week.

Other proposed updates to the marine advisory would warn against consuming part of any shark more than 43 inches long and limit eating smaller sharks and spotted sea trout more than 20 inches long, Henderson said.

The proposed advisory also recommends that people in the Florida Keys should cut down on eating snook, red drum and permit.

An updated mercury warning has been delayed for more than a year because state health officials wanted the language to be simple and easy to understand without causing people to stop eating fish altogether.

"I'm frustrated the advisory has not come out sooner," Henderson said.

But he said there are conflicting studies to sort through on mercury's effects.

"They're in a quandary," Henderson said of health officials. "They're trying to give good health advice. One part of that is to eat fish. The other part is to limit your consumption of certain fish."

great event today. Congratulations. 


Manatees - I am going to try to convince my fellow commissioners that we are
sending a confusing signal to the public with our downlisting. Also, this
does not change how we manage - it is just a different name. I would like to
explore consolidating the three levels of listings into one. Saves a ton of
staff time and does not diminish protection. 

On the other side - CCA wants this downlisting. To happen and they may have
the votes. 

I have discussed with colleen and she agrees with aproach. 

If you want ti discuss give me a call or I can stop by early on wed. I leave
for jax at 9:30 in the morning.

Subject: Irene Guy for appointment as Hillsborough Supervisor of Elections


Dear Governor Bush,
I write in support of the appointment of Irene Guy to fill the vacancy being created by the resignation of Pam Iorio as Hillsborough County's Supervisor of Elections.
    I have known Irene Guy for about eight years, and have served with her on the Board of the Tampa Tiger Bay Club, where she served ably in many positions of leadership, including two terms as our President. Irene is a warm, witty, and highly intelligent woman of high principal. She has great skill at motivating people and is able to bring together people of different ideas and beliefs to work for the greater good.
    Her professional career has been marked by success after success, as Verizon has consistently promoted her and continuously puts her in positions of great responsibility, knowing that she will get the job done, and that she will do it in a way most favorable to her employers. 
    She has always been a strong, vocal supporter of yours and has always been a strong advocate for the Republican party. Yet while clearly a partisan Republican, she is liked and respected by people of both parties. Irene Guy is universally considered to be a fair, able and loyal person, capable of performing any job at the highest level.
     Her appointment to this position will do honor to your commitment to maintaining a fair, modern and reliable election process. Her appointment would be popular with the people of Hillsborough County, and would further your own reputation of appointing skilled, competent, and fair people to positions of great public trust.
    I very much appreciate your consideration of these words in support of Irene Guy.
Respectfully,
Herbert M. Berkowitz

Subject: Hospital Appointment Petition Drive Update


Jeb

The petition drive in south east Volusia County asking you to appoint candidates who agree to ask the people what they want to do with their hospital is just starting:

1. Upwards of 1,000 citizens of South East Volusia County have signed.

2. We have not had a single reported instance of a citizen refusing to sign.

3. We have just started to approach our elected representatives and have been surprised at the support:

     A. Every elected Commissioner, the Mayor and Chief of Police of Oak Hill have signed the petition asking you to nominate the four candidates including Mike Thompson, a long term resident of this small city (Note: Faxed to Mavis today) 

     B. I have been told that you will be receiving petitions from several members of the New Smyrna City Commission. They support the right of the citizens to vote on the future of Bert Fish. They also reported deep frustration with our hospital who now refuses to accept both Blue Cross and Aetna insurance. Last year the city changed to Aetna from Blue Cross so their 200 plus employees could again use the hospital. Today the city's employees have no access to their hospital and Aetna is asking them to complain to the insurance commissioner about the hospital's refusal to accept patients at the "standard" reimbursement rate of 120%of Medicare.

4. Robert Thomas, applicant from Edgewater, is the Pastor at the largest African American church in New Smyrna Beach. He reported that everyone asked, signed in the hopes that you would end their frustration over being left out and nominate candidates who would give them a voice in the future of their hospital. (Note: These signed petitions have been faxed to Mavis)

5. Dr Susan Hole, applicant from Edgewater, has started to collect signatures from other doctors and the results are instructive. While over a dozen doctors have signed (Note: I faxed the Doctor's petition to Mavis today), several have refused. Dr. Ownby, applying for a second term from Edgewater, refuses to let the people vote because they might "negatively impact funds for indigent care." Several other doctors would sign but are afraid of losing business from Florida Health Care, a subsidiary of Hallifax-Fish.

Jeb can you help us reverse the policy of your predecessors appointees who made a decision to merge our hospital behind closed doors and give the citizen-petiton-signers across the political spectrum a voice in deciding the future of Bert Fish Hospital?

Can we get together to discuss? 

Jeb have you ever run a campaign in a one-man one-vote election that didn't have an election day?     

Would you recommend we do an overnight poll to test the water? :)

The good news is that the election results will be clear. :)

Dear Governor Bush:

On December 26 my wife Sherri Bowers e-mailed you
concerning the adoption of our nieces and nephews. 
The children's names are Brandon, Aren, Cheyenne and
Misty Hayes.

My brother-in-law Kenneth Bowers and his wife Lisa
live at 5200 SW 42nd Court, Jasper, Florida 32052. 
Their telephone number is 386-938-5670.  They have
been involved in adoption proceedings for
three-and-a-half years.  Several times, case workers
have given Ken and Lisa a date when the adoption would
become final, but each time it has been postponed. 
Now, I am told that the judge has on his desk an order
to remove the children from my brother-in-law's home,
awaiting only his signature for enactment.

These children call me "Uncle", and it breaks my heart
to think that they might be taken away from our
family.  We have spent Christmases, Thanksgivings,
Easters and family reunions together.  The children
have grown to be as much a part of our extended family
as their many, many uncles, aunts and cousins who were
physically born into it.  Their grandparents love
them.  My father-in-law died peacefully this past
April, secure in the belief that Brandon, Aren,
Cheyenne and Misty, his only grandchildren, would
carry on his memory.  The people at our church love
the children and inquire about the status of the
adoption every time we see them, as do the members of
several other churches where the kids have made
friends.

We are not a wealthy family, but we are comfortable
and reasonably well educated.  I sincerely believe
that this extended family can provide the support
network that the children need in order to have a
secure and happy upbringing.

If there is anything at all that you can do to bring
this adoption into being, you would be working a
miracle in the lives of four innocent and much-loved
children.  Thank you for any help that you can give.

Sincerely,


John S. Dobbs

Dear Governor Bush:
     First let me congratulate you on winning your second term of office as Governor of the Great State of Florida.  Thank you for working with the City of New Smyrna Beach.
 
     The reason for this e-mail is a concern I and my fellow city commissioners have with the inabilty of using our local hospitals under our current insurance carrier.  You may be aware, that Bert Fish and Halifax hospitals do not accept Blue Cross or Aetna Insurance as payment in their facilities (except for emergencies).  The City of New Smyrna Beach  uses Aetna for many of its employees health care benefits.  With this current situation, our city employees as well as many of our citizenry are being forced to look outside our city for hospital care.  
       
     This should raise concern for all elected officials in that we have a situation where two of the largest insurance  carrriers in this state are not recognized at two of our local tax supported hospitals.  
 
      Please give this matter your utmost attention when you choose the next board members for Bert Fish Hospital.  New Smyrna Beach residents and employees deserve to be able us utilize local care facilities for any health care issue that they might encounter. 
 
      Thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail and for your attention to this very serious matter.
 
 
Repectfully,
 
 
 
James W. Hathaway
City Commissioner
New Smyrna Beach

Dear Governor,
 
    I am sure that the announcement of Pam Iorio, Supervisor of Elections in Hillsborough County, to run for Mayor of Tampa has not caught you off guard. However, If you have not yet made a decision on who might be the replacement for this position I would like to throw my name in the hat.
 
    As you are aware, I am very interested in publicly serving the State under your leadership. I have submitted my resume to your Transition Team and have spoken to Alan Levine of South Bay Hospital several times regarding my interests. I have asked to bring back the position of Agricultural Liaison, I believe with NAFTA and recent attempts to make a more open trading block with all of the America's can be a benefit for the farmer or, if not handled properly can be devastating to our farmer's.
 
    Should the Agricultural Liaison position be considered or any other position within your administration be considered for myself, I would prefer to serve you directly. However, being a third generation Hillsborough County Native, I could be an asset to the position of Supervisor of Elections. Thank you and God Bless you and your family. The health and leadership of the Bush Family are always in my prayers.

Dear Governor Bush:

Interstate 4 median is unprotected for crossover head on's!  This is totally
unacceptable!

Again!!!  People were killed when their auto crossed Interstate I-4 median.
I refer to the accident January 2, 2003, when Andrew Knapek and Christophter
McConnell were killed when their auto crossed the median on I-4 and struck
an
oncoming truck.  I fully believe that this was possibly preventable - if a
median barricade was in place.

In the early '90's on I-4 between Lakeland and Tampa a median barricade was
constructed after several publicized median accidental crossovers resulted
in
fatalities.  When I-4 was widened in the mid '90's the barricade was not
replaced.  I think this is unacceptable.

Today I returned from an auto trip from Virginia and noticed that several
states have Interstate barricades in the median that are simply three (3)
strands of cable that will "catch" a vehicle crossing the median and help
prevent a head-on collision.

We need to do everything reasonable to make our highways as safe as possible
and I fully believe that Interstate median cable barricades are a reasonable 
justification of highway tax dollars.

                    Sincerely,

Good Morning, Jeb.  May you, the family, and Florida have a great 2003 
and better years ahead under your proven leadership. I had written 3-4 
months ago about suggesting reference to the publication from HHS in 
1988 on Professional Liability Reform. This came from Secretary Dr. 
Otis Bowen's and my concern over the seriousness of the same issue at 
that time, since both of us had experienced the consequences as 
physicians in practice. I am including a portion of a message from Dr. 
Donald Palmisano, President-Elect of the AMA. He and our own Florida 
physician, Dr. Yank Coble, current President of AMA, are completely 
involved in this crisis as it covers the nation. Dr. Palmisano refers 
to a current report on the issue from HHS which you may want your staff 
to know and to access. This may already be in your files, but just in 
case.

Portion of article:

"Because of the powerful external validation of what AMA and the rest 
of organized Medicine has been saying for years, I try to include in 
every medical liability interview the excellent report of July 24, 
2002, "Confronting the New Health Care Crisis: Improving Health Care 
Quality and Lowering Costs by Fixing Our Medical Liability System", by 
Health and Human Services (HHS) concerning the problems with the 
current medical liability system.

In the live TV interviews during the past 4 days, I was able to mention 
it and give the web site of HHS.GOV where the public can download the 
report.
The advantage of this is that those who want more information can read 
this important study from a government source".

Again, best for your continued success......Bob

Dear Governor Bush: 

It is with great pleasure that I recommend Ed Curtis for the above-referenced position.  Ed has a wealth of experience and knowledge to draw upon to make fair and just decisions as a circuit court judge.  Maybe even more important than knowledge and experience in being a circuit court judge are people skills.  Ed has those, too, and anyone who meets him knows that.  Ed likes people and it shows. 

Ed is scrupulously honest and his integrity is beyond reproach.  Ed will be a credit to the bench, as he has been to the Bar.

Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor, State of Florida:
 
 
I have known Mr. Joseph W. J. Robinson for over fifteen years.
 
He campaigned for the position won by Pam Iorio.  I voted for him and he was runner-up in that election.
 
I respectfully request that you give serious consideration to appointing him to fill that position from which Pam Iorio has recently resigned.
 
Appointing him to this position could be justified by the election returns where he received votes of confidence from the public second only to Pam Iorio.
 
However, for many other reasons you would not regret his appointment.
 
I know of no one who would work as hard to ensure that the voting process in Hillsborough County would be free from criticism from the media and Republican opponents.
 
Early in my professional association with Mr. Robinson I became impressed with his leadership skills and his continued focus on fairness and equity in pursuit of business opportunities.
 
He would be a champion of your political agenda.
 
He appreciates loyalty, exhibits loyalty and rewards loyalty.

Hi Jeb:

First, let me congratulate you again.  I am writing this as you are being sworn in.  What a historical moment! I hoped to make it to Tallahassee, but this week marks my last semester of Law School.  My thoughts are with you.  You have an exciting four years ahead of you.  
I truly admire those who are fortunate enough to live their dream of public service.  I continue to work for those I believe in (I seem to have a better track record for others :) G-d has a plan!  Who am I to argue)?  Anyway, I do want to give you my thoughts on a judicial candidate interviewing this week.  His name is Ed Curtis.  I have known Ed for a number of years and I am familiar with his background.  He has what it takes.  As I get closer to the legal profession, I feel compelled to advocate for those who will have the power to interpret our laws, and will do so with integrity.  Much depends on the character of those who wear the judicial robe.   Ed has experienced a great deal of triumph and adversity, which only served to make him stronger throughout his life.  He maintains positive energy and a desire to make a difference.  He works hard and plays hard, but most importantly, his seasoned legal experience will be a tremendous asset for those who will come before him as a judge.  His intellect, along with his compassion and commitment to serve is something to be admired.   
I have worked hard over the last few years to support and advocate for those who I believe will serve us best. There is no doubt that Ed is one of the best!  I am sure you will interview many fine candidates, and I just wanted to share with you my thoughts on someone I admire and know will make an excellent addition to our judiciary.  

All the best,

Ellyn

Hi: 
A very healthy, prsperous and Happy New Year. 
A while back I wrote and asked for the name of the person to whom I could send a resume. 
Your office responded with an electronic web site for the Transition Team. 
I did exactly what was asked.  I was not looking for a specific position. 
I submitted my resume with qualifications for the team to look at and possibly, and since I have worked hard for Jeb since 1994 and never have asked for anything, there might be a position for which I qualifed. 

On January 6th I received a telephone message to call Sheila Griffith of the Transition Team. 
Upon arrving from New York I responded to the message. She could not even remember what she had called me for but shortly thereafter she did recall. 
The purpose of her call was to inform me that Jeb had designated Mr. Crosby for Corrections Commissioner, which I did not understand since I had not applied for any such or specific position. 
Just wanted to give you a heads up since I did not wish for my resume to be discarded thinking that I was applying for the position in question. 
Best regards,

Jeb, 

Re: the attached Article from AP 

If we could really work together we could make Florida the number one state with computers in classrooms. And not with donations from people and not only ONE computer in each classroom but one computer for each child in each classroom.

Couldn't your office cause a article to be written about the "point of light" that you have found to put a computer in front of every child not just one per classroom? Without more taxes, without digging deeper into everyone pockets, without it costing the school or the parent more money and without begging to people for donations.

I have really build up our non-profit company as well and can aid Florida with receiving LARGE E-rate refunds from the Federal government. AND we have just found a loophole in a federal law that can allow your districts to apply for large amounts of your teachers and admins salaries to be refunded to the district from Federal and it is retroactive for 2 years.

I called Brewser a month or so ago and he didn't remember me at all. He had a lovely lady call me back to see what I wanted and who I was. After telling her she was so enthusiastic about the AmEdu project but Brewser still didn't call back. He had invited me to the Florida budget meetings but when I tried to follow up he was un-contactable.

Jeb, after all these years and all the trials & tribulations in our families and in our country, couldn't we plan a time to chat on the phone for a few minutes?  It can be in the evening or weekend or most anytime that is convenient for you.

I hope your family is doing ok, oh by the way, just found out that you are also Catholic. I went through RCIA about 18 years ago.

Always wishing you and yours the best, 

Richard

Miss. Puts Computer in Every Classroom 

By MATT VOLZ 
The Associated Press 

HERNANDO, Miss. (AP) - In a milestone for student achievement and state pride, Mississippi has become the first state to have an online computer in each of its public-school classrooms, a spokesman for the governor said.

The state met the goal set by Gov. Ronnie Musgrove to connect Mississippi's 32,354 public classrooms to the Internet by Dec. 31, spokesman John Sewell said Wednesday.

The accomplishment has added importance in a state that has often found itself near the low end of educational and economic rankings.

``I've never known Mississippi to lead the nation in any educational category or technological category,'' said Tom Pittman, publisher of The DeSoto Times in northern Mississippi. ``It puts us at the forefront of something that is 

significant and important.'' 

The idea to hook up all the state's public classrooms to the Internet began in 1999 as a challenge offered up by Pittman's brother, then-America Online chief executive Bob Pittman, at a meeting of the Mississippi Economic 

Council. Musgrove, a candidate for governor at the time, made the challenge part of his campaign. 

The job required $40 million worth of equipment and training, but federal funding, private donations and programs that trained students to build computers meant the project cost the state just $6 million, according to Musgrove's office. Donations included $500,000 from Mississippi native and former Netscape chief executive Jim Barksdale.

Besides Mississippi, the state closest to filling classrooms with online computers is Delaware, according to the National Governors Association in Washington.

Now that the computers are in place, the schools will have to train teachers to use them and pay for maintenance, upgrades and connections, Sewell said. Some of the costs can be eased with federal education programs and by 

training students to fix computers, he added.

Re: Comments and Objections to Proposed Rule
on Incidental Taking of Florida Manatees
67 FR 69078, November 14, 2002
(Dock Moratorium)

Dear Governor Bush:

In regard to the proposed dock moratorium, we believe that there are many things to be considered before this inane proposal is put into effect.

1. If there are no new boat docks, it does not mean there will be less boats.  It does mean that there will be more boats at already overcrowded boat ramps - a much greater risk to Manatees.

2. If a dock moratorium is issued, it will not mean that no docks will be built.  It does mean that the honest dock builder will be out of work and illegal contractors will have a field day.  It needs to be noted that when mangroves were not allowed to be trimmed, the mangroves started to disappear "overnight".  This indicates that unrealistic methods of conservation have a tendency to backfire.

3. There are three times the number of Manatees today than there were ten years ago.  And twenty years ago, it was a rarity to see a Manatee.  Why is this?  I believe because of boater awareness and concern.  No one wants to harm a Manatee.  I think it is a slap in the face from certain groups to insinuate that anyone would.

4. The Save the Manatee Club (SMC) states that the Manatee is "the best, most effective growth tool that exists." (Pat Rose, New York Times, Feb. 2002 - by Andy Revkin).  In Florida Sportsman, in February of 1994, he stated: "People in Florida have to realize that you're going to have to put a lid on growth.  And if this animal is the vehicle to do that, then so be it!"  What?  Is it the Manatee they are concerned about?   It sounds like a different agenda to me!

5. In any of the lawsuits that these groups have instituted have the boaters' rights been considered?  Or the personal rights of the waterfront homeowner?  It does not look like it.  Is this legal?  Is this ethical?

6. Economic impact: wide range.  There would be a huge impact on many industries (manufacturers, suppliers, builders, etc.), but more importantly, the people employed here would be devastated.  Bottom line: docks not being built will not in any way reduce the number of boats, but will affect many, many families in ways that are not reversible.  This is the ultimate "no brainer"!

Let me give you an idea what it would do to myself and my family.  I have been a dock builder for most of my adult life.  At the age of 51, if my livelihood is yanked out from under me, it will be virtually impossible to find another job for which I would be qualified.  This would mean financial disaster for my family.  My older son, who is in this third year at the University of Florida would have to quit.  He is very bright and deserves the opportunity to complete his education.  My younger son is a senior in high school.  He wants to be a veterinarian.  Imagine that, the "Save the Manatee" so-called cause would keep him from reaching his dream of helping all animals.   We would lose our home, our way of life - the list goes on and on.  This is just one example of the ramifications of this ill advised proposal - there would be thousands of similar stories all across the marine industry - and all for a proposal which will not have the desired results of "saving the Manatee".  Is this possible in the democracy that we call the United States of America?  Let's hope not.

There is a logical, common sense solution to the problem of protecting the Manatee.  What needs to happen is simple.  We don't need to eliminate boat docks (has a dock ever jumped out and killed a Manatee???  I think not!!!)  Boaters need to be educated and there needs to be more law enforcement patrolling the waterways.  There are tens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of boats registered in the State of Florida - all of them renew their registration annually.  Add $5.00 to each registration renewal.  This will provide the necessary funding to educate boaters (why not require all boaters to take a safe boating course) and provide more officers on the waterways - and the funding would be renewable every year.  It seems so simple, it's hard to believe this alternative has not been suggested.  

Doesn't this seem more reasonable?  The dock moratorium will result in loss of jobs, loss of tax base, loss of personal rights, (guaranteed by the US Constitution by the way), loss of property rights, etc.  The suggestion put forth above will put the responsibility on all boaters who will all help pay the way by the nominal addition to their vessel registration each year.

Please do what you can to stop the US FIsh and Wilelife Service from being irrational in their knee jerk reaction to a law suit filed by the Save the Manatee Club (and others) that was not based on scientific fact (Manatees are more plentiful than they've ever been).  Let's face it, all of us (boaters and not) would like to see the Manatees survive, and continue to thrive (which they are doing).  Let's be rational about how we accomplish this task.

Sincerely,

7 January 2003 

Dear Gov. Bush,

 I am expressing my concern to you regarding funding for crisis/runaway shelters for your constituents who are involved in CINS/FINS (CHILDREN/FAMILIES IN NEED OF SERVICES) programs.  I feel sure you recognize the need to maintain and enhance these services and will increase the funding for them in your new budget.

 You need only drive the streets of many of your communities to see our youth with no place to go because their behavior has caused them to be kicked out of home or school.  These youth need help, and through shelters and other programs available to them they are finding their way home and back in the classroom once again.

 Please don't cut funding to these programs.  If you won't increase the funding, then at least keep it at its current level.  Putting these kids in jail isn't the answer.  Our kids ARE our future.  Let us help them find their way.

Thank you for listening to me.

Dear Governor: 
I am writing to ask you to please continue to assure that we can have music and arts ed in the public schools.  It is wonderfully enriching for children and families from ALL walks of life. 
 
In December, I attended the freshman guitar class recital at Leon High for 60 children (my niece was performing).   Last year, I attended her 8th Grade Band Concert for Raa Middle School, held at Ruby Diamond.   It brought tears to my eyes to see these young people perform, watched by parents, siblings, and miscellaneous relatives such as I. The kids learn skills that they will use all their lives, and as well as poise in performing.  Their self-esteem and sense of accomplishment grows as they master new skills.  The families enjoy the live music.  These are great events, and for many people would not be available if not in the schools.   Please continue to make these great experiences possible. 
 
Sincerely,

Shortly you will after to appoint a new Election Supervisor for Hillsborough County.  I hope you will consider Al Higgenbothan to serve the remaining two years in this critical position.  He is organized, listens to others ideas, treats those with whom he works during campaigns with the utmost respect, and is fair-minded. 

Again, please consider him for the appointment.

I welcome the chance to work with you at some point, in some capacity.  I

Maybe you can talk with other Governors and get them to contact the President and help pressure him into keeping his promises and doing the right thing. So many Veterans from so many wars suffer because they don't get their retirement because it's taken away if they're disabled. To watch a Veteran loose his home because he is unable to work because of a service connected disability should never happen, and it wouldn't with Concurrent Receipt.

Thank you for writing. I am passing on your email to our reading team. As you may know, there is no new system in terms of the responsibilities for implementing reading programs. That responsibility continues to be the local school district.

Subject: family at Inaugural Celebration BBQ


Hello Jeb Bush, 
       My name is Helen Thompson and my son is Will,  We met at the BBQ. I simply want you to know that we approve of the Phonics Program because we are the typical target audience.  We have gone from non readers to volume readers, no the word is not voracious,  We read volumes of material now to reach automaticity. 
       Once we read : Mat, Sam, and  Gum on the Cat.  This was our own Phonics Program.  But now we can read.  
       Last year we read STEP UP biographies Meet: Abraham Lincoln,  Benjamine Franklin,...and we read If You Were There When They Signed the Constitution,   We wondered why education became a state regulated right, because it varies so much from state to state. ( and district to district)
        This year we read Maximum Boy:  Attack of the Soggy Underwater People.   (a series of 8 books, number 8 will be released in February and we could read it to you to demonstrate our prowess). Now we can read material we choose because phonics works and we can read.
       We also read longer books like Harry Potter and the RedWall series.  For these we take another strategy,  since our early books had 1-4 sentences on a page we do that.  Will can read the beginning sentences and then I read the rest. This allows us to read adult vocabulary in which complex words can be decoded,  followed by a rest in which mom carries the plot.  
       We also use another  technique in which Will listens only, this allows for vocabulary development.  (at 8 yrs he had the vocab of an 11 yr ) (It is not the only program nor is it the one we use the most, but Will has a high IQ and his mind demands more substance than his reading level provides. Here we may read Bulfinche's Mythology or a Wrinkle in Time.
       There is only one other thing you need to know ,Will was declared Dyslexic at the end of First Grade, with a deficit in rapid naming, which is visual processing not with a hearing or auditory deficit.  In second grade his in class teacher used, as the primary teaching method, a method  called Model Reading in which she read to the class.  His beginning of the year reading score showed that he was reading on the second grade level, with our diagnosis he was given a special reading program, for hearing impairment, ending at the end of the year with a promotion to the third grade now reading at the first grade level.  We regressed !!!!!!!! now we had a  2 year deficit.       We appealed and were given a ruling of _NO CORRECTIVE ACTION NECESSARY.
     We want you to know that we are out here and we have suffered in the hands of the school system, we were there before the new system arrived. Please don't sell the Phonics  Program short and provide a partial program which says we provided a program,  it doesnt matter if it works or not. 
       We can learn to read,  We have !!  We can learn to work hard, We have !!  We can help lead the way, some times we know a better way!!  We do.   Look at Charles Schwabb, Look at Will,

Dear the Honorable Jeb Bush,


The crisis / runaway  shelters are a necessity to help troubled youth and 
their families.  I am urging you to please consider increasing  or at least 
keeping these services funded in your new budget.  Last year, 30,000 
children were served in crisis shelters and family counseling throughout the 
state of Florida.  As someone who works with at-risk youth, I am terrified 
to think what might happen if the shelters don't exist.  Where will these 
young people and their families turn?  They need an opportunity to get back 
on track rather than to be punished or ignored.  Please don't cut these 
services and allow the youth and their families a chance at making better 
choices.



Sincerely,
Erica Sparks

Dear Governor:

We had a ball at the Inaugural Festivities.  Thank you. Great message from 
you as well as Monsignor O'Doherty on strengthening the family! 

You provided validation on our work with Family Table Time. 

Our hope is to get tablecloths on tables all around Florida in 2003.

We are excited about following up with Major General Burnett, should we do 
that or wait to hear from you or him?  (An idea: What about Publix sponsoring 
kits for the families??)

We are neophytes in working with government. Any guidance you can give us 
would be appreciated.

What we have done so far:
We attended the introductory meeting with the legislative Committee on The 
Future of Florida Families yesterday; so far we have shared our tool with 
Dept. of Children and Families (Ken DeCerchio); Dept. of Juvenile Justice 
(Rod Love and Chris Canty); Dept. of Education (Linda Thompson, Martha 
Asbury, Lou Marsh and Debra Armenti). All of them expressed excitement about 
Family Table Time and how it could support their work.

Do you like these avenues and/or do you recommend others to try? 

I've just finished "The Tipping Point" for the second time...we would like 
Family Table Time to "tip" in Florida to help YOU with your agenda!

You and your family are continually in our families prayers,

PS Next time you are in the Orlando Area, I would love for you to see the Springs and the Little Weikva River.  It is vital that recharge wetlands not have development otherwise you will destroy the Springs, The Weikva Springs, the little Weikva River and the Weikva River.  Florida sits on the world band of deserts and can easily end up being destroyed.  There is one thing man cannot live with out and it is water.  By doing environmental programs for the International Visitors program I have learned a great deal and how sensitive Florida's environment can be turned upside down.  Remember that the Weikva runs into the St. John's.  The St. John's is being studied for surface water use, but at this time it is all experimental.  What good is all this development if their isn't the water to support the development.  Thanks for listening!!!

Dear Governor, After watching your second swearing in of office, I paid close attention to your speech about family. Although I don't totally agree with all of your politics, I do however respect and agree with your position on family, and the values thereof.  My problem is or should I say my confusion about the way family court is handled here in South Fl. leaves something to be desired Mr. Governor, to be brief, in 1987 I was introduced into the family courts division of Broward County, because of a case involving shared parental responsibility,and child support, now I do however agree that there are a lot of fathers out there whom don't give one thought about bringing children into this world and doing nothing to help raise, support, nuture, or provide for the upbringing of these children. I, on the other hand,had it all planned, to be there, help raise, support, and give my son whom the law says and allows that I have a God-given legal right to be involved in his life, without going into all the legal details and possibly boring you with have been in and out of court for the past 16 to 20 years for, just trying to have a relationship with my son whose name is Anthony!! at one point there seemed to be some relief based on the letter of the law, but somehow through all the legal wranglings and loopholes, I have been what our founding fathers have declared left out of the loop, meaning with the courts knowing that my son's mother left the state, and manipulated the welfare system for all these years, failed to uphold the law which I am entitled to,that is to make sure the best interest rule applied to myself as well as my son and his mother.  It was in the best interest of my son to have the loving affects of both his parents in his life and he was denied this because the law failed and failed miserably. After tryin to fight this back and forth for so long I did beg and appeal to the courts sense of what suppose to be fair play, but through no avail, now after all this time when I go into the court of clerks office to review my file, remember I did say it started in 1987, I was told that the file after a certain amount of time is destroyed, now I don't believe this and if the paper is to be thrown out then it should have been on mircofich film, which it is not, andf all that remains is a thin folder with none more than a few pages of much recent filings and rulings. my request to you Mr. Governor is with all you have to contend with in this state I respectfully asked that if it is all possible, and I don't see why it wouldn't be, barring stepping on any legal toes(maybe you need to) is you could appoint some watch dog group to oversee the system here in Broward County, because there is a lot wrong here sir, I have a grown son out there who dosen't know me maybe don't want to know me, living a lie for the past 20 years, but yet I am being persecuted even now because of a woman who used and lied her way through the system and intentionally kept her own son from knowing his father along with the blessings and support of the court system.  Because, if I am to live with for the rest of my life, having my parental rights stripped away from me and people inside the system allowing this to go on and totally ignore it and with all the other obvious cases that are going through the same thing no doubt, then how is it that the state is continuing to take money away from me, knowing my signatrue is on the birth certificate, and nothing inside or out side of the law ever pervented me from being a father to this young man except the court system here and the people who you are suppose to govern over this system, there is a miscarriage of justice here Mr. Governor, and if I could afford legal counsel to repersent me in this matter I wolud have done so long ago instead of having some lazy attorney do nothing but be buddy buddy with the opposing side and still allow this to happen. You are my governor, Sir, and as a citizen of the great state of Florida I am asking for your help, even though I did not vote for you, I do however respect and support your ability to run this state as you see fit for all the citizens not just a chosen few.  I eagerly await a positive response from you.

Dear Governor Bush and CFO Gallagher, 
I am writing to your personal email in order to encourage your support of
Kevin McCarty as Florida's first appointed Insurance Commissioner. As the
individual who is responsible for regulatory relations for Blue Cross Blue
Shield of Florida (the state's largest health insurer), I have worked with
Mr. McCarty for several years. He is an exceptional regulator; accessible,
knowledgeable and fair. While he certainly does not grant all of our
company's requests, he treats all filings with equity and objectivity. He is
consumer focused yet thoroughly understands the business needs of insurance
companies. In this challenging environment, a regulator who understands the
need for justifiable rate increases is critical to continued survival.
Finally, I have personally observed the respect he commands at the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). What a positive reflection on
the state of Florida!		
Thank you for taking the time to receive my input. Thank you for your time
and consideration.

Dear Governor Bush:

It was an honor and pleasure to attend your campaign stop at the
Aventura
Turnberry Jewish Center yesterday along with Mayor Giuliani.  It was a
very
nice presentation and one that I believe had a positive impact on a
traditionally Democratic population.  I was pleased to hear you mention
the
issue of malpractice reform and surprised when you specifically
mentioned
our hospital's recent (and unfortunate) decision to close our OB service
due
to the outrageous cost of malpractice insurance.  After your
presentation
you asked about the total costs and revenue regarding this service.  I
can
send you lots on info, but in brief... We paid approximately $1,000 per
delivery to cover the cost of OB related malpractice insurance.  We
receive
about $2,500 - $3,000 per delivery in payments from insurance companies,
HMOs, etc.  However, our total costs per delivery (including malpractice
insurance) is about $3,500 per delivery.  Therefore, in the 6+ years the
program was open, we delivered about 850-900 babies per year, losing
about
$500,000 -$750,000 each year.  During this time, we never ever had a
lawsuit
filed against us for an OB related issue, but still our OB related
malpractice premium totaled about $1 million per year.  OB represents
only
about 2% of our total patient revenue, but accounted for 26% of our
total
malpractice insurance costs.  Most hospital OB programs are not
financially
self supporting.  But the larger OB programs rely on the revenue
generated
by Level II and Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units to offset the
losses
incurred in the OB service.  Since we only have a Level I nursery, we
did
not have this option. Since the service was not a core service for us,
we
determined we needed to focus our resources elsewhere to better serve
our
community's needs.

Sometime after the election, I would like to write you about our need
for
approval of our CON application for Cardiac Surgery services.  Due to
our
demographics, what made OB a challenging service to provide, (an elderly
/
cardiac disease prone population) demand we provide Open Heart Surgery
and
Angioplasty services. But without State approval, we can't.   We see the
second highest volume of non-surgical cardiology patients in Dade County
(That's right! More than, Cedars, Jackson, Mercy, Baptist, Miami Heart,
Palmetto, etc).. Only Mt Sinai sees more than us. We have about 80
cardiologists and Cardiac / Thoracic surgeons on our staff, and we boast
the
newest State-Of -The Art Cardiac Cath Lab in the area.  Yet, we send out
about 350-400 patients each year for cardiac surgery and angioplasty
services which we could do here (based on or great equipment and
physicians)
but can't, due to lack of CON approval.  Many of these patients are
comprised and even jeopardized as a result of the inherent delays
involved
with these transfers. We have a unique agreement with Mt Sinai in which
they
will close one of their two Cardiac Surgery programs when we get
approval to
open one here at Aventura.  Yet our application was denied under AHCA
Secretary Rubin King Shaw (even though the AHCA staff recommended
approval)
and is currently under appeal.  While still under appeal, we intend to
file
a second application in this current CON cycle.  Over the past year, I
have
met with AHCA Secretary Rhonda Medows, and she seems interested in and
sympathetic to our needs and our unique agreement with Mt Sinai which
effectively places a new Cardiac Surgery program in an area of great
patient
need without adding a program to our Health Planning District.
Basically we
will be locating a program from an area of excess resources to an area
of
need and without the local resource.  We had over 14,000 signatures and
360
letters of support form our local community for this program and perhaps
with your help we may someday be able to offer this service in our local
community.  If you have an interest in reviewing this issue and helping
us
bring this needed service to our community, I would be happy to provide
you
with more information or perhaps meet with you and Secretary Medows to
discuss it further.  

Again, it was a pleasure to see you here in Aventura.  Good Luck on
Tuesday
November 5th... I am confident you will be celebrating another victory!
Thanks,

A really sad state of affairs.

Congratulations on your re-election and for being the first Republican
Governor to be re-elected.  Your assistance is needed.

The City of New Smyrna Beach is served by Halifax/Bert Fish hospitals.  Our
insurance carrier (Aetna) has lost it's contract with the hospital group.
In addition, Blue Cross Blue Shield has lost it's contract (except for
Medicare) with the hospital group.  Over 100 city officials and employees of
New Smyrna Beach (police, fire, elected and appointed) are affected.  In
addition, the Southeast Volusia Chamber of Commerce has indicated their
concern, as many as 10,000 residents and over 100 small businesses are
affected by the loss of these providers.

The City Commission of the City has directed the City Manager to take such
action as is necessary to maintain coverage.  We need your assistance.
First, we are hopeful that your appointments to the Board will be concerned
about this matter and make it their first item of interest.

Second, I would like to talk with someone in your or in the Insurance
Commissioner's Office.  The matter is extremely complex and we are not
privileged to the information regarding the exchange between the two
parties.  Our insurance carrier has been most helpful in the sharing of
information regarding negotiations. Information that we have been provided
thus far is inconsistent.  We are interested in making sure that our
employees, residents and businesses are able to retain their coverage, their
doctors and their local hospital for their health care needs.

We will be happy to share what information we have.

Frank Roberts

AND ON BEHALF OF OTHER STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ENTITLED TO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY SERVICES AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AND PHYSICAL THERAPY SERVICES 

As stated on the attached comments to the Draft Report of Inquiry, "The services of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy are in a state of chaos in M-DCPS… Routinely, M-DCPS fails to provide and routinely denies the related services of Occupational Therapy and the related services of Physical Therapy to the students who require these related services in order to assist them so that they can benefit from special education."  Instead of fulfilling its obligation under federal law, The Bureau is choosing to continue to remain in non-compliance and to continue to waste our precious tax dollars in implementing a system of monitoring which continues to be "not effective."  It is no secret in Florida that school districts know that they are "The Untouchables" and behave as such, since FDE fails to hold them accountable for their actions. This Draft Report of Inquiry and cover-up is a perfect example of "what's wrong with the system?" and the reason why more and more parents each day are choosing to participate in the McKay Scholarship Program!  This is the only way that parents of children with disabilities can exercise their dissatisfaction with this broken system in Florida, and we have to count our blessings.  A system that for decades has failed to provide FAPE in the least restrictive environment to those it has been funded to serve, and, instead of "serving" the children, it makes victims of them and of their families.  A system that for decades has failed to be accountable for the immense waste of human potential!

They are hopeful that the new Commissioner will be someone with innovative ideas to deal with the problems in Malpractice insurance, property and casualty and health.  The same approach to insurance will not suffice for these people who need relief. I hope you get someone who can work with you shares your vision.
 
Thank you for your kind consideration.
 
 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush, 

I have just finished reading your inaugural message, and I wanted to thank you for being who you are.  How fortunate I am to live in a state where our Governor is such a wonderful role model to children as well as adults.

Thank you for putting "Reading" as a priority in education. As an elementary teacher and as a mother, I applaud your promotion of reading. 

Thank you for expressing your family values. What a blessed state we are to have a family man as a governor. Please know that there are many people praying for you and your family.

One last thank you for writing to my 3rd grade students (2 times) during your campaign. My students have felt so special since you took the time to write to them.  It was as if a light were lit within them. They now feel as if all things are possible. Thank you so much!

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,
 
 
I am writing to you with the understanding that Sheriff Phil Williams may be stepping down from his position as Sheriff to assume duties as Judge for the 18th Judicial Circuit.  In the event that this occurs I would like to ask you to consider Jack Parker for the job as Sheriff of Brevard County.
Jack Parker will be an excellent choice to take command of this Department.  Mr. Parker has served many years with the Brevard County Sheriff's Office and the Department of Public Safety with great distinction.  Mr. Parker is a positive role model, a strong leader and he is more than qualified to assume the duties as Sheriff.  I know that the citizens and employees of Brevard County will benefit greatly by having this man in office.  I have been employed with the Brevard County Sheriff's Office for 15 years, my wife has been here for 17 years. We both know first hand the type of leadership that Jack Parker will bring to this Department.  I appreciate your time and consideration in this matter and truly believe you will make the right decision.  Thanks again.
 
Respectfully submitted,
 
Sgt. Frank T. Hickman Jr.

To the Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,

     Sheriff Phil Williams of the Brevard County Sheriff's Department has 
advised his employees that in a few weeks there will be a major change in 
the department.  Speculation is that Sheriff Williams may be leaving and an 
interim Sheriff may be appointed until a special election can be held.  If 
this is correct, I would like to endorse Jack Parker for the position.
     I retired from the Brevard County Sheriff's Department a few years ago 
after 30 years in law enforcement, and 29 years with the Brevard County 
Sheriff's Department.  Need I say, my heart and soul are still with the 
department.  After working with Jack it is apparent to me there is no one 
more concerned about the citizens of Brevard and the direction of the 
Sheriff's Department than Jack.  Jack will lead the department by example 
and will give the deputies a sense of security and pride.  Also, I apologize 
for the incomplete e-mail that was sent to you.  That was caused by a 
mistake clicking on the mouse at the wrong time.

Dear Sir,   

It was brought to my attention that Sheriff Williams could be stepping down from his position as Sheriff of Brevard County as soon as January 14, 2003 to assume duties as Judge for the Circuit Court for the 18th Judicial Circuit.  In the event that this occurs, this will open the door for a new qualified, positive role model to take charge as Sheriff of this County. His name is Jack Parker and he currently holds the position of Director of Public Safety for Brevard County. I have known Jack Parker for 15 years,I first met him when he was a Sergeant at the Detention Center. I watched Mr. Parker rise from the ranks to hold the position of Chief Administrator with the rank of Major for the Brevard County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Parker held that position till his departure to assume his current position as Director of Public Safety.  Mr. Parker is a strong, positive, qualified and intelligent  leader that would be an asset to the people of Brevard County as well as the employees of the Sheriff's Office.

I, for one, urge you to appoint Jack Parker as the next Sheriff of Brevard County.  I retired from the Sheriff's office after almost 15 years service and I can't think of anyone who would do a better job for You, the citizens of Brevard County and the employees of the Sheriff's Office.

Thank you for your time.

Subject:	academics and career academies


Hi-
There is an education consultant that really inspires me.  I've finally accomplished getting my committee to hear him and they are very excited.  I sent you a few of his thoughts on education a few months ago. Dr. Porter will be speaking to us, hopefully within the next two weeks.  He would like to meet with you and I really feel that you would enjoy talking with him and hearing his ideas.  One of the many things he advises on is Career Academies. I really like his model and his ideas.  If you would be interested in meeting with him, I would love to arrange that.  I really think he has some proven ideas that could really contribute to many of your educational goals, including basic academics, reading etc. 

The following is some basic outline information he sent to me:

1) Benchmark the best. Take key stakeholders to Denmark and Scotland 
via my example (7 days Sunday thru Sunday). Get people excited flying 
back with a 'draft' vision of what a new 'system' could look-like 
(not more than 25 people at one time or two groups of 15--one group 
studies Denmark the other Scotland and then bring them together on 
the Saturday before they leave with a common vision); 

2) Focus on the end (first). Develop a vision of a new Florida high 
school graduate and what s/he would look like (not a list of 
graduation requirements-but a real rite-of-passage profile of a 'high 
skilled' young adult. I'll send you an example of what I mean that I 
recently helped the State of Hawaii develop). This will get 
everyone's attention quickly; 

3) Change high schools. Start a major state-wide initiative on career 
academies via the California model (e.g.,tight design criteria, 
planning funds for one year, a 'director-level' position leading the 
initiative, major business and industry support, etc.). The former 
California director, Susan Tidyman, is now a national consultant 
working out of University of California and can help the Florida 
Education Department get this off the ground; and 

4) Create Pipleline Programs. Feeding into the new Florida Career 
Academies will be a series of literacy, math and science acceleration 
'Saturday Academies' for student grades 4-8 (co-sponsored by NASA). 
Allow each school district to start them only after they have 
successfully implemented their State 'endorsed' career academy (the 
Saturday Academies run each Saturday except for holidays and two 
weeks during the summer on a nearby college/university campus. The 
are designed for at-risk students that are two or more grade levels 
behind in reading and/or math. The 'state director' for career 
academies should also also responsible for the Saturday Academies). 

If you started just these four things systemically, Florida public 
education would never be the same again. You'll be doing several 
things at the same time that some researchers have been advocating 
for years: 1) create a new vision of what's possible; 2) redefine the 
end, now, for everyone; 3) implement a proven design that works 
quickly that supports the new vision (so people can link best 
practice designs to a new belief system). 

See what you've done--you have me rambling on now. I'll be glad to 
help you and the council anyway I can. I would love to meet the 
Governor whenever possible. Maybe on the same trip that will be 
planned for the whole council? Let me know.

This excerpt doesn't give you a full picture of Dr. Porter.  I know your time is so very valuable and I will understand if you don't have the time to meet with Dr. Porter.  I have a feeling you would find that he has great insight and proven models. He is very dedicated to education success. He beleives when we draw organizational charts, the student should be at the top of that chart.

Sorry for the long e-mail.

Have a good evening.
Diane

Dear Sir,
 
I am writing to you concerning an issue that is very close to my heart. It is an issue that is going to have a direct impact on my family and many families of hard working deputies, who put their lives on the line everyday. My husband works for the Brevard County Sheriffs department and today we heard that our sheriff may be appointed a judgeship. This would leave us without a sheriff, and you will be appointing someone to take his place until the next election. We would respectfully request that you consider Mr. Jack Parker, director of emergency services, for the position of Sheriff.  Mr. Parker worked for the sheriffs' department for many years and rose to the rank of major during his tenure. Mr. Parker is strong, positive, qualified and intelligent. We have the utmost confidence in his leadership.
 
Mr. Bush, the issues that effect my husband have a direct impact on my family and we respectfully request that you consider Mr. Jack Parker as a most qualified replacement for our current sheriff. We need to be comfortable in our future and we feel our best opportunities lie with Mr. Parker.
 
Thanking you in advance for time and consideration,

Dear Governor Bush:

I just got back from Tallahassee and it was a wonderful Inaugural!

Right after you delivered your address yesterday, I went to the Board of Governor's meeting and met Tom Petway and Pam Pfeifer.

I explained my situation to them and Pam asked that I send her my resume and apply on-line at the transition site.

The site has a section in which I am supposed to list three people who recommended me.

Would you mind if I listed you as on of the three people?

I researched everything regarding my graduation and I can finish up my education in Tallahassee.

It would really be an honor and priviledge to serve in your administration and the people of Florida.

Thank you Governor, for everything.

I am sure you realize that a great leader does not avoid those who have views are different from yours.
I won't take anymore of your time but will leave you with a question and I do not mean to be  impertinent by it I truly want to know.
If racial preferences are wrong for universities and are to be opposed there, why are they okay for other situations like police and fire departments and state and county agencies etc.?

Oh no Governor I applaud you for One Florida that is a great start. I just thought that article got to the essence of the evil of "affirmative action."
What I had in mind was a hope that you would embrace Ward Connerly and strongly support his statewide initiative in Florida(the one that mirrors California's) that would eliminate racial preferences by all forms of state govt. at every level, not just state universities and contracting.
I was hoping too that if you had any input with the President that you would encourage him to allow the justice department to submit a brief in the Michigan case arguing against racial preferences because on principle they are wrong-they are dehumanizing.
One Florida was a good first step but there is a long way to go. There are many grass roots conservatives like myself who are waiting for a strong statement from our leaders like you and your brother that on principle  all forms of state based racial discrimination are wrong.  
Once again respectfully,
Tim Murray

Dear Governor,
Please take a stand on principle and come out against racial prefernces. A color blind government is the only way to proceed. No matter what amount of good intentions you have, you cannot fight evil with an evil. "Affirmative action" is wrong because (as stated in this excellent article) it is dehumanizing. It dehumanizes those people who are "walked over" in order to meet a certain racial goal.

Subject:	Proposed Change To FS 419 - SB178

Dear Senator Cowin,

I am the parent of a beautiful 19 year old developmentally disabled young lady (Brittany).  I am also the co-founder of a grassroots, not-for-profit organization called Noah's Ark of Central Florida.  Our mission statement reads: 

"Noah's Ark is committed to empowering individuals who have developmental disabilities by advocating on their behalf and by providing or facilitating meaningful employment, recreational and social opportunities and affordable housing choices".

Today, I received an e-mail from another parent organization referencing SB178 which proposes to ammend FS 419 (which, in part, related to the proximity of licensed group homes to other single family homes).  After reading the proposed changes, I am in shock and disbelief.  

The proposed language requiring a group home be located a minimum of 500'  from an existing home is unrealistic.  This would mean that all future group homes be located in rural locations which creates another wave of challenges for this fragile population (transportation, support services, access to employment, community inclusion, shopping, etc.).  I would like the opportunity to talk (or meet) with you so that I may try and understand the spirit and purpose of your proposed ammendment.  I do not see any upside in your proposal for individuals with disabilities.

I would also like the opportunity to help you better understand the unique needs of individuals with developmental disabilities and the incredible demands that face their families on a day-to-day basis.  

In the past four years, Governor Bush has demonstrated extraordinary leadership in trying to meet the basic needs of individuals with developmental disabilities.  The legislature has increased funding for Developmental Disabilities dramatically but there is still a "waiting list" of over 10,000 individuals who are not being served (including my daughter).

If SB 178 is adopted, it would have a devastating effect of the future of thousands of individuals with disabilities and their families.

When can we talk?  I can be reached, day or night, at (863) 816-7499.

Respectfully,

Jack Kosik

It has come to my attention that our present Sheriff Phil Williams may be moving on to a Judge ship in the 18th Judicial Circuit. I am glad to see the man move up, however what does concern me is his replacement. I have been a Deputy Sheriff in Brevard County now for seventeen years. In that seventeen years it has been an honor and a pleasure to work for and with Mr. Jack Parker (Director of Public Safety) for Brevard County. Mr. Parker, I have personally known for over 15 years and in that time I have gotten to know him and the kind of man he is. He is a great family man and a hard worker from day one. He rose though the ranks in the Sheriffs Department and was one of the youngest person on the department to become a Major and Administrator. As an Administrator Mr. Parker took the job and ran with it. He did this until becoming the Counties Public Safety Director. Mr. Parker is a strong leader, he has positive qualities and the kind of integrity and intelligent it takes to Be our next Sheriff in Brevard County. Please know as a senior Deputy Sheriff with the Brevard County Sheriffs Office Mr. Parker has my total loyalty and respect and I would be proud to work for him.

IF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NOW PRESENT SHERIFF OF BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA TO CIRCUIT COURT IS NOT GOSSIP, THEN I WOULD ENDORSE AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO APPOINT MR. JACK PARKER, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SAFETY TO THE POSITION OF SHERIFF OF BREVARD COUNTY.
 
ALSO I ENCOURAGE AND ENDORSE THE APPOINTMENT OF KENNETH FRIEDLAND, COUNTY COURT JUDGE IN BREVARD COUNTY TO A CIRCUIT CIVIL POSITION.  BOTH THESE GENTLEMEN ARE VERY QUALIFIED AND FINE PEOPLE; WOULD BE AN ASSET TO THESE POSITIONS.

Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,
 
Sir, my name is Scott Pikus and I am Deputy Sheriff with the Brevard County Sheriff's Office.  I have been a Deputy with Brevard County for 20 years and for the past six, I have been the Brevard County Sheriff's Office Representative for the Police Benevolent Association (Coastal Florida PBA Chapter).
 
It has come to the attention of the member's of the Brevard County Sheriff's Office that Sheriff Philip B. Williams may be seeking an appointment else where and that he will no longer serve as Sheriff of Brevard County Florida.  In the event this is true,  I and the vast majority of the Brevard County Sheriff's Office employees and PBA members would endorse Brevard County Pubic Safety Director, Jack Parker as a replacement for Sheriff of Brevard County Florida.
 
I have known Mr. Parker for the 20 years I have been a law enforcement officer.  In my opinion, Mr. Parker portrays the highest standards of integrity and professionalism and his appointment as Sheriff of Brevard County would be an invaluable asset to the employees of the Brevard County Sheriff's Office and more importantly to the citizens of Brevard County Florida.
 
Thank you sir for taking the time to read this.
 
Respectfully,
 
Deputy Scott Pikus

Governor Bush,
    I am writing to pass on to you my support for a candidate in an upcoming change of law enforcement leadership in Brevard County.  Although I am currently serving with the Florida Air National Guard here in Jacksonville, and have been since recalled on 9-11, I am also a part-time deputy sheriff with this department and know this individual very well on a non-personal, professional level.  His name is Jack Parker and he is truly representative of the type of individual who will preserve the safety and integrity of everyone in the county and of his employees.  He is an intelligent and thoughtful individual who would have the respect and trust of the personnel working for and with him.
    My respectful suggestion is for you to meet the man yourself and discover how easily your confidence in him grows, providing you with the type of leadership we need in this State.
    If I can provide any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at the number below, or via my voice mail at 321-258-3393.
    God Bless and good luck in your well-deserved second term.

They're short on time for a substitute if you can't do it. HELP. Thanks.

Dear Govenor Bush,

It was brought to my attention that Sheriff Phil Williams could be stepping 
down from his position as Sheriff of Brevard County as soon as January 14, 
2003 to assume duties as Judge for the Circuit Court for the 18th Judicial 
Circuit. In the event that this occurs, I hope that you would appoint Jack 
Parker as his replacement.  He is a qualified,positive role model to take 
charge as Sheriff of this County.  He currently holds the position of 
Director of Public Safety for Brevard County. I first knew about him when 
he was a Sergeant at the Detention Center. I watched Mr. Parker rise from 
the ranks to hold the position of Chief Administrator with the rank of 
Major for the Brevard County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Parker held that 
position till his departure to assume his current position as Director of 
Public Safety. Mr. Parker is a strong, positive, qualified and intelligent 
leader that would be an asset to the people of Brevard County as well as 
the employees of the Sheriff's Office. I know that Jack Parker will be an 
excellent choice for Sheriff of Brevard County. Thank you for taking the 
time to read this and we hope that you will make the decision to appoint 
Mr. Parker as Sheriff.

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:
I have been reading the book "Bush at War" by Bob Woodward.  I am genuinely 
impressed by the manner in which the President has shown integrity and 
courage in the very distressing, confusing time after 9-11.  His valor is 
evident.

You have appointed a new Secretary of Corrections. I know nothing about this 
man. I only pray that he will be more interested in combating the corruption 
within his Department than did his predecessor.  In the book about the 
President, I see little tolerance for evildoers.  Evil is still evil, whether 
it be inmate or Warden.  Our sense of freedom and justice is based on equal 
treatment of offenders.  If sworn officers of the law can plant false 
evidence, if Wardens can threaten, terrify, and torture inmates without 
reprisals, then the very foundation of truth and justice has been broken.

We personally warned you that Daymond had been threatened to be set up.  It 
happened.  We told you that he was threatened with harm.  It wasn't by chance 
they placed him in a 10 by 10 cell with a sexual predator.  In the middle of 
the night Daymond was forced to defend himself from sexual molestation.  He 
is in the Butler Medical Institution where they are evaluating whether his 
broken had is mending properly and whether it will need pens.  It took three 
weeks and a letter from Daymond's attorney before they even x-rayed or 
treated his hand.  No wonder there is a question whether it is healing 
properly.

Dear Jeb Bush-
I read in the paper today that Brevard County Sheriff  Williams may be taking a position with the state as a state judge. Therefore you will have to appoint a new sheriff to Brevard County. As a very loyal republican, not only did I  voted for you twice (made you the first republican governor to be re-elected in Florida in 100 years, congratulations), but your great President brother (who will win a second term), and your father, who lead us to victory in the Gulf War. I know the Bush family cares what is best for our country and its citizens. I am asking you to consider Jack Parker to the position of sheriff. He is well liked by his peers ( I personally know many deputies), and they also would like to see Jack Parker appointed. For us in Brevard County, it is very important who you appoint. It is a decision that we have to live with. Jack parker is a fair, well experienced sheriff, with many years serving directly under our last sheriff, Sheriff Miller. There is no one who can better serve this office in the county than Jack Parker. I'm sure after your considerations, you will find Jack Parker the best qualified person for the job. 
Thank You for your time and May God Bless You and your family  through these tough times.

Joe Robinson is the right man for the supervisor for elections in tampa and we need your support.  I am a ryhme master at your service. 

An Introduction to Dr. San Man

He is referred to as Dr. San Man, with words that heal the soul, as he has reached out grasping the experiences of life as though it were a voluptuous fruit, savoring it's tasty nectar translating it into spoken word. The Ambassador Poet and Tampa Icon noted for his charisma, his smile and his entertaining nature is available for your hospitality needs. Dr. San Man was raised in Japan son of a Colonel in the United States Army, which allowed him to travel extensively throughout the U.S. and Far East Asia. Dr. San Man has also visited Morocco, in Northern Africa were he enjoyed digesting the diversity of how other cultures live, worship, work and play adding insight to the inspiration of spoken word. Dr. San Man began writing poetry at age 11 in Pusan, Korea when he was confronted with the fact that the world did not live as well as he'd been lead to believe.

Dr. San Man attended eight High Schools in five different states finally to settle down in Tampa Florida in 1982. He is a graduate of Hillsborough Community College in Justice Administration to attend The University of South Florida were he studied Political Science, Philosophy, Religion receiving a graduate scholarship opportunity in Correction Special Education. Upon becoming bitterly disappointed in how formal education is an instrument used to conform society and not to elevate the thinking of the people, "people with Ph.D.'s run the world and just witness the destruction they have uncovered: a piece of paper with a dead person on it means more than the living who suffer at the hands of the economy."

Dr. San Man has maintained a diary of poetry for over thirty years with topics that entail politics, religion, racism, equality, romance, poverty, ignorance and life in general. He has fought for human rights locally and on the state and national level causing him to run for public office, to initiate several youth organizations and writing grants to accomplish the goals he has set forth. Dr. San Man recently began touring the United States delighting his audiences that will soon extend to Africa and Ireland reciting poetry and spoken word from his published book, "A Poetic Buffet to Reality", Volume I, She Is The Key. These poems illustrate the majesty and strength of the woman as a reflection of the man. Dr. San Man's works are available in a unique form of recording on CD and cassette: we have T-shirts, bumper stickers and a line of San Wear. Dr. San Man can be viewed weekly @ noon on www.hawkradio.com. It is the desire of Dr. San Man to share peace and love with all he comes in contact with through his poetry and short stories. Ignorance is the key to self hatred and all other social ills that confront our society. He believes he is fulfilling his destiny by sharing this inspiration with the universe as we rise into the new millennium. For Booking information call 813 258 2792

A Single Drop of Water

A tiny drop of water fell from the universe,

ultimately fulfilling life on earth.

As this drop of water divided itself in two:

from the essence of my love I brought forth you.

Witnessing a falling star, soaring through space

on that star I saw your lovely face.

It lit up the heavens the way your smile brightens my souls,

as the wisdom of civilization began to unfold.

Holding the entire universe in the palm of my hand,

you are my woman and I am your man.

An this single drop of water that fell from the universe,

was you my love to quench my thirst.

as I walk with God without known fear.                                            It is through the evaporation of rain eternity has begun.

Strengthening my spirit each and everyday,                        It can be iniquity of heavenly divine,

understanding life the more I pray.                                         because the purpose of life is generated by the sunshine.

Truth is my destiny and heaven is my goal,                       Adding to my wisdom, things I do not know,

forsaking the lies, I've been told.                                                 the more I understand the more I grow.

Understanding wisdom to conceive love,                                     I look to the meadows for heavenly desire,

is better than fame, fortune and all the above                                      forsaking the sunshine, which is eternally higher.

In searching for peace of mind,                                                                                    The giver of life and essence of all:

The wisdom of God comes from within

the more you understand the less you sin.

Governor,   This morning's newspaper, Florida Today, indicated that  Brevard County's current sheriff may seek to fill a circuit judge vacancy.  In the event that should happen, I would like to recommend Jack Parker, Brevard County Director of Public Safety, to fill the position of sheriff.
            I have known Jack professionally and personally for ten years. I first met him in 1993 when I was serving as Warden (now retired) at Brevard Correctional Institution, and Jack was a Major in the Sheriff's Department Merritt Island Precinct. At that time he was also a volunteer at Crosswinds Youth Services,  a junvenile delinquency prevention and reduction program in Brevard County and was President of the Board of Directors. I was also elected to serve on the board and had first hand opportunity to see Jack function in a leadership role. He did a truly outstanding job. He was later promoted to the sheriff's department Business Manager, and served there until the current sheriff was elected in 1996. The new sheriff kept Jack on and appointed him to run the county jail operation, which again brought us in close contact. Jack did an outstanding job there as well until he was appointed to his current position as Brevard's Director of Public Safety.  Additionally, after a brief hiatus for family reasons, he continues to serve as a volunteer on Crosswinds Board of Directors.       
           He is state certified in Law Enforcement, Corrections,and Fire Safety. He is well experienced, knowledgeble, and has excellent communication skills. He is a dedicated husband, father, and community leader. In all my interactions with Jack over the years, I have always found him to be honest, reliable, trustworthy, and productive. 
            It is truly an honor and pleasure to recommend him to you should the Brevard Sheriff's position become available for appointment.
 
 
Respectfully Submitted,
Dave Hemme,  Warden (Retired)

Dear Governor Bush
 
I understand the position of Sheriff may soon be opening if the present Sheriff of Brevard County, the Honorable Phillip Williams steps down to be appointed as Judge of the Eighteenth (18th) Judicial Circuit.
 
I am writing you in regards to supporting an outstanding person for appointment to the position of Sheriff of Brevard County.  
 
I have been employed with the Brevard County Sheriff's Office for the past 32 years.  I feel I have enough time in service to evaluate dedicated persons of excellent character who perform in their positions with positive direction.
 
I have known Jack Parker for the past 15 years.  I  worked for Mr. Parker during his tenure with the Sheriff's Office in the Civil Division.  I met Jack Parker when he was assigned to the Brevard County Detention Center as a sergeant.  He rose through the ranks and was last a Chief Administrator with the rank of Major in the Sheriffs Office prior to becoming Director of Public Safety for Brevard County.  Jack Parker is a dedicated servant of Brevard County.  
 
Jack Parker will surely represent the citizens and law enforcement community with high trust and dedication.  I know Mr. Parker to be a strong, qualified, and intelligent individual.  He is very caring and maintains a positive demeanor to others at all times.
 
I respectfully request you review Mr. Jack Parker for this position. I feel he will be an excellent choice to assume the role as Sheriff of Brevard County.

Dear Governor Bush,


I'm sending you this e-mail to recommend Jack Parker, the Public Safety
Director for Brevard County Florida for the position of Brevard County
Sheriff in the likely event that the current sheriff, Phil Williams, steps
down from this position and accepts a post as a Brevard County judge.  I've
worked with Jack Parker as Medical Director of the Brevard County Fire
Rescue Emergency Medical Services system, which includes medical oversight
of eight municipalities in Brevard County.  Jack, as Public Safety Director,
has been instrumental in weaving a coalition of municipal EMS systems
together under the umbrella of the Brevard County Fire Rescue service as
well as doing an outstanding job of coordinating the county Emergency
Management Office in this time of heightened disaster preparedness. He also
oversees an efficient and affective county Medical Examiner's office. As
Medical Director for an emergency medicine group that serves all of south
Brevard County, I can safely say that we are unanimous in our praise of Mr.
Parker's management of the EMS/paramedic system in our county and are
unanimously supportive of his potential appointment as interim Brevard
County Sheriff.  We in the Emergency Department rely as heavily upon
supportive law enforcement dealing with our emergency medicine patient
issues as we do depend on good pre-hospital care of our patients by
paramedics.  As Medical Director for Emergency Medical Services in Brevard
County, although we will miss Jack as a Public Safety Director, I am very
comfortable with the team that he has nurtured to replace him in this
position.

Subject: Possible Sheriff's vacancy in Brevard County


Greetings Governor Bush,
 
I read with interest in the Florida Today newspaper this morning that the Sheriff of Brevard County is considering applying for an open Circuit Court Judgeship in the 18th Circuit. Should this actually occur, I would like to make a personal recommendation for his replacement.
 
The current Director of Public Safety for Brevard County, Jack Parker, would make an outstanding Sheriff. Before moving over to his current position, he was a career law enforcement officer in this county. I came to know Jack in January of 1987 when I gained employment with the Sheriff's office. I started as a line officer in the Brevard County Detention Center, and Jack was my immediate supervisor. He guided my career with the skills of a mentor, exhibiting true concerns for not only my learning curve, but my personal safety as well. He genuinely cared for the Officers that reported to him, and constantly strived to make the work environment one that you looked forward to every day. He is an effective communicator that possesses an excellent sense of humor. His people skills serve him well, as I've witnessed his expertise in defusing critical incident situations, making it appear seemingly effortless.
 
When Jack was promoted to a management position with the Sheriff and left the Detention Center, a collective gasp was heard throughout the ranks. While we all missed his presence, we were very grateful for the time he guided us, and knew that he would continue to do well. Jack rose through the ranks of the Sheriff's Department, and eventually was entrusted with operating the Detention Center. I've not seen a more devoted, loyal, and dedicated officer. 
 
It's obvious to me that there is a very valuable and capable resource to be considered should the Office of the Sheriff become vacant. A person of very high integrity, that actually came through the ranks of the department, is knowledgeable of most all operations and support aspects, and most importantly, looked up to and respected by all who know him.
 
I severed service with the Sheriff's Office in 1999, but will be forever grateful for the experience of having served with pride. It is my sincere hope that you would seriously consider Jack Parker for the Office of the Sheriff for Brevard County if you are asked to make the selection. He is the right choice to keep the pride alive.
 
Thank you for any consideration in this matter.

   Just so were clear, my story is not just about your e-mailing prowess.
It's part of a broad, comprehensive profile I'm working (which I know

would it be OK if I e-mailed questions as I go, questions that arise
somewhat randomly, in the course of my research? For instance:

   1) I've read much about Andover -- your time there, and the school
generally. Given how formative and challenging that experience was for you,
how did that it shape, if at all, your later views about education?

   2) What three technical/scientific innovations from the last 40 years
would you least want to live without today?

   3) What word(s) best describe your feelings about all this Jeb in 2008
speculation?

   4) What three historic figures would you most like to eat lunch with?

    5) What book(s), above all, have most profoundly nurtured your
political/ideological/leadership self?

  (Feel free to skip any of these, obviously.)

Dear Gov. Bush,

The State Board of Funeral Directors & Embalmers, during a telephone conf.
meeting this morning, asked me to
express to you the Board's concern regarding the level of service being
provided to licensees and the public by DBPR.

The Board has been supportive of the re-engineering project and new
technology at DBPR, however there has been a lot of frustration over how it
has been implemented.  Your appointment of Diane W. Carr this afternoon to
be the new Secretary is welcomed....her resume indicates she is well
qualified to lead.

The chairpersons of the Boards at the Div. of Professions met several times
over the last year to be updated on the re-engineering project with the
former Secretary Kim Binkley-Seyer and her staff.  Hopefully, the new
Secretary, at her earliest opportunity could schedule another such meeting,
to hear concerns and look for ways to work together to improve service.

Respectfully,
Ken Roberson, Chairman

During your initial campaign for Governor, I had the opportunity to meet you at one of your campaign stops in Cocoa Beach.  When we were introduced, I asked you how you were doing and you simply stated "I'm tired."  We laughed, you left, and I have never had the opportunity to meet you again. These two words are the only things I remember from your campaign because they depicted the true character and honesty of the man we are fortunate to have as our Governor.

I know another man that possesses these same qualities and if rumors in Brevard County are true, I would like to ask that you give serious consideration to Jack Parker to fill the Sheriff's vacancy should Phil Williams be appointed Judge.

I have known Jack Parker for several years, having worked with him as a member of the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, and having observed his work as Public Safety Director during the terrible wildfire season of 1998.  Jack is an experienced leader who knows how to get the job done.  Having been a former Police Chief in Kentucky, I have an idea of what Jack will be facing should he receive this appointment.  With the constant threat of terrorism and  the need for a well founded homeland security, Jack is a truly capable candidate to continue the programs instituted by Sheriff Williams as well as develop his own programs to protect the citizens of Brevard County.

Thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail, and sir, please get some rest.  Ha!

Kevin McCarty, Florida Department of Insurance deputy insurance commissioner, was appointed director of the new Office of Insurance Regulation today, but only on an interim basis * for 90 days. Governor Jeb Bush and the Cabinet will re-advertise the job to attempt to attract experienced insurance regulators from other states for consideration.

McCarty's interim appointment came during the first meeting of Bush and the new Cabinet, consisting of Chief Financial Officer Tom Gallagher, Attorney General Charlie Crist and Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Charles Bronson. His duties will include approval of insurance rates and forms, approval of certificates of authority and regulation for market conduct and solvency.

Bush had apparently favored the appointment of another applicant, Michael Blackshear, manager, KPMG, Washington, D.C, while CFO Gallagher supported McCarty, one of his top aides. The compromise developed by aides to Bush and Gallagher Wednesday was that  McCarty serve as insurance regulation director for 90 days with the state re-advertising for the position and another, permanent appointment coming in late March or early April. 

The permanent appointment could go to McCarty, but both Bush and Gallagher indicated they would seriously consider experienced insurance regulators from other states, including insurance commissioners who may have lost their jobs with new governors taking office around the country early this year.

Only eight candidates applied for the position and only five met the statutory minimum qualification of five years experience in insurance, either in the industry or as a government regulator.

*I'm concerned that we didn't have a field of applicants that was deep and robust,* Bush said.

Dear Jeb,
 
As a long time FL Republican and as Irene's former husband for many years, I want to enthusiastically suggest that you appoint her as the Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections.
 
Forgetting the obvious personal reasons that I would recommend her, I would like to summarize below a few key points for your consideration:
 
1. Irene is a life long resident of Tampa and is deeply entrenched into the local business and political environment.
 
2. Irene is a "self made" person of substance having created a career at Verizon since she started working part-time when she was in high school. No "silver spoon" for her!
 
3. Irene had always been a tireless supporter of the Republican Party, both as a private citizen and as the head of the former GTE political PAC.
 
4. Irene has the proven technical and management background to ensure that this office can become the State's finest example of how to blend the use of modern technology with "good old fashion" people handling skills in order to create an efficient Supervisor of Elections Office. Her background includes the day to day managemnt of hundreds of telecommunication workers functioning in today's complicated emerging world of technology. No one else mentioned in our local papers comes close to her management background. This background would justify her appointment regardless of her political party affiliation!
 
5. Irene's current position at Verizon has also effectively prepared her to understand the importance of the blending of telecommunications, technology, and reading skills into a systematic campaign to successfully develop the young future voters of our county. I have no doubt that her ideas on how to use this office to increase the reading skills and the understanding of the values of our most cherished right..the right to vote...will become a national example for all!
 
Seldom does a governor have a decision that is such a "sure fire" opportunity for immediate success!
 
I thank you for your consideration!

Congratulations, you and your family looked lovely at the ceremony. Much luck in your second term. 
Jeb, our Town Manager is meeting with Ralph Arza tomorrow morning about a hammock in Miami Lakes. I suggested that he stop by to pay his respects to you. Please give him five minutes, he is absolutely wonderful. His name is Alex Rey. He is great to work with and does a fabulous job with no fuss or excuses. He has already saved us a fortune.
Please meet him, Jeb, you will really like him. Also, we really need that hammock, we have so few parks and this would be passive and historic because there is an Indian burial ground in the middle of it.
Thanks so much. Again, I am so proud of you and your administration. Noelle looks fine, she will make it, don't worry.
Love,
Mary Collins

John started phase two of chemotherapy yesterday, 6 more months and then he will be home free!

Governor,
 
(just picked this up on my home computer: Jan 9/ 08:12 PM).  
 
Sir, I would like to do some research and get back to you. 
 
Quite honestly, I have serious concerns about "sanctioning" such an organization.  Did you see the part about the "20MM cannon"?
 
I know the Nat'l Guard leadership in NY and NJ and will discuss with them the operational issues concerned with a "Naval Militia"

Subject: Proposal for Florida State Naval Militia.


Governor

PROPOSAL:  It is proposed the the State of Florida Create a Florida State Naval Militia, under the Control of the Governor and sponsored by, and under the auspices of, the National Guard Bureau, U.S. Department of Defense. The Florida State Naval Militia would be under the direct command of the Adjutant General of the Florida National Guard who is appointed by the Governor and Reports to the Governor. A Florida State Naval Militia would be a cost effective, highly visible organization that would enhance Homeland Security in our State with it's extensive coastline and numerous important Harbors, Ports  and Rivers and would give both the citizens of the State and anyone wishing to harm the State a visible, viable Naval presence that would otherwise not be available and would enhance the already valuable efforts of the U. S. Coast Guard.  A Florida State Naval Militia would be readily available for The Governor to use during either a State, or Natural Emergency 

BACKGROUND: Other States in the United States have had and continue to have State Naval Militias under the direct Command of their State Adjutants General, notably; New York and New Jersey. The U. S. Navy  started as a Naval Militia early during the Revolution. The Naval Militia would use readily available Naval and/or Armed Forces Reserve Training Centers and National Guard Centers and might possibly be able to use Active Military Installations for their training facilities; therefore, no new facilities would be needed. Historically, the various Training Facilities have had no difficulty in providing adequate space and support to Naval Militia units. In fact, many of the Naval Reservists already training at the aforementioned facilities would form the bulk of and/or the nucleus for the State Naval Militia units. Additionally, Coast Guard Reservists other Armed Forces Reservists, with some kind of maritime background; i.e; Army Transport and Engineering Specialists, Active or inactive Merchant Marine personnel, Veterans, Navy Fleet Reserve members, Naval ROTC (University) and Junior NROTC (High School), Coast Guard Auxiliary, Port and Harbor workers. i.e; Tugboat crews. as well as civilian volunteers would be the additional resources to man the Florida State Naval Militia Units. The U. S. Navy would be requested to supply any available surplus vessels to the Florida State Naval Militia. It is envisioned that the surplus vessels requested would be, diesel powered, medium or small sized tugs or harbor craft, medium or small sized landing craft, small minesweepers and possibly riverine warfare craft, gun boats, or other types of vessels to would be compatible with the Florida State Naval Militia Mission Statement. Landing craft could be outfitted with emergency diesel generators and fuel bladders that could be deployed in the event of a disaster to provide emergency electrical power to hospital or other emergency facilities.

RECOMMENDATION: The Governor and the Legislation enact enabling legislation to establish a Florida State Naval Militia coordinating said establishment with the U. S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau and establish at least ten Florida State Naval Militia Units to be located in or near large population areas and at locations having immediate access to either a major port or river. It is further recommended that any vessels obtained from the U. S. Navy be limited to easily maintainable, diesel powered, uncomplicated electronic suites, weapons no larger than a 20 mm cannon and that the vessels need not be manpower intensive. Landing craft are ideal as they can easily and safely navigate our rivers, bays, offshore islands, and be readily available for many different emergency uses.

NOTATION:
The undersigned is a Retired U. S. Navy Senior Officer, a Commander, with 22 years of Active Duty, Commanding Officer of a Destroyer in the Pacific Fleet during the Vietnam War, Decorated for Heroism, and had a subspecialty in the Training and Administration of the Naval Reserve who had personal experience with both the New York and New Jersey State Naval Militias during a three year tour of duty while stationed on the Staff of the Commandant third Naval District. The undersigned stands ready, willing and able to consult with, advise, expedite or help in any way desired to enable this proposal to come to fruition

Dear Governor Bush:

 

Hope you are energized by the Inaugural festivities, and congratulations on a well-deserved second term.  (Glad to be home again our warmer South Florida!)

 

Sir, please appoint Ron Harbison to the Palm Beach County Children's Services Council, which is in true need of a new appointee with tremendous fiscal experience.  

 

As you well know, this particular Council is just one of a few among our 67 counties to have local taxing authority.  The Children's Services Council also provides funds to the School Readiness Coalition of Palm Beach County-that is one of several local agencies I have worked with directly; in fact, it was a client of mine last year for ad hoc public relations services.  The School Readiness Coalition is implementing a number of new laws you enacted with the Legislature's passage.  In fact, nearly every single one of the new provisions calls for across-the-board changes.  These changes-as I witnessed directly-are forcing very intense negotiations of a complex fiscal nature.  The transfer, tweaking, or improving of multi-million dollar budget items for child care subsidies and child development requires a keen, careful, conservative eye experienced in fiscal work.

 

We need someone like Ron Harbison on that Council, which already has plenty of education, child care, and care provider representation...it needs more representation along fiscal management lines.  Ron is a former partner in a CPA firm and worked at Coopers & Lybrand.  He is now a principal in a successful local firm doing high-level mergers and acquisitions and other business growth services.  He's even a former IRS agent!  I hope you will appoint Ron Harbison-he has several children and is very well-known here in the business community, which will appreciate his perspective on the Council.  Thank you.

 

Sincerely,

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor For The State of Florida

Dear Governor Bush: 

It was reported this morning in our edition of the Florida Today Newspaper that Sheriff Williams is under consideration for an appointment as a Circuit Court Judge, in the 18th Judicial Circuit. In the event that Sheriff Williams is appointed to this Judiciary position, I respectfully recommend that you appoint J. R. (Jack) Parker as the Interim Sheriff for Brevard County. 

I am currently enjoying my seventeenth year in law enforcement, and have had the personal and professional pleasure to call Jack Parker a true friend over the past eighteen years. As you are well aware, Jack is an outstanding representative of Brevard County. Jack has an impressive background in law enforcement with distinguished service as a Command Staff member for both former Sheriff C. W.  (Jake) Miller as well as the current Sheriff, Phil Williams. 

Jack was appointed Director of Public Safety for Brevard County during 1998 and currently manages the largest county department with 700+ employees and a 52+ million dollar budget. 

Jack Parker is a true professional who's strongest attributes are honesty, integrity and leadership. I am truly honored to submit this recommendation, and would greatly appreciate your favorable consideration of J. R. (Jack) Parker for the honorable position of Sheriff for Brevard County.  

Thank you for your consideration.

Governor, good afternoon! We have just heard from your scheduling office
that none of the proposed February dates for you to again serve as guest
speaker at our Committee of 100 Annual Dinner will work, but look forward to
having you join us in Tampa again soon to celebrate our diversified economic
base that you have helped to build and sustain.

On a separate issue, I wanted to make you aware of very recent developments
as a follow up to my previous correspondence regarding the significant
potential "window of opportunity" that the Fed's Draft White Paper provides
to Florida. We have been informed by several corporate site selection
consultants that Florida's inducement/incentive programs are not being
viewed as competitive when compared to other southeastern states, and in
fact, a sizeable gap exists.  The source of contention is the availability
of job development tax credits that are funded through a withholding of that
state's personal income tax for its employees, and which can be used for
land, building, utilities, training, employee relocation and other upfront
start-up costs.  Since Florida doesn't have that personal income tax revenue
stream available to fund such a program, our position is viewed as
uncompetitive - from a corporate standpoint.  

We realize that there are tremendous budget pressures confronting you and
the Legislature.  But we believe that two potential solutions could exist
and might be worthy of further discussion to help close the perceived gap:
a) funding the already-approved "Closing Fund", which would allow companies
immediate assistance in offsetting the initial costs of relocating their
senior and mid-level managers, and b) making all current QTI target industry
clusters eligible for the Capital Investment Tax Credit against their
Florida Corporate Profits Tax.  This would then extend the application to a
potential major financial service company project's entire capital
expenditures, not just that portion allocated to Information Technology.
Such an extension of the CITC would seem to be revenue neutral for this
fiscal year, while providing a much needed economic development "tool" to
secure major corporate facility expansions and relocations. 

Any guidance and direction that you would have on this issue would be much
appreciated.

Kindest regards,

Robin

Attached is a copy of the Draft "White Paper" on Sound Practices to
Strengthen the Resilience of the US Financial System, as recently
released
by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
Treasury
Department and Securities and Exchange Commission.  This has become the
driving force for redundancy of critical operating systems in response
to
September 11.  The ability to provide ongoing processing of US Dollar
transactions by JPMorgan Chase Treasury Technologies here in Tampa, when
the
NYC site became enveloped by the collapse of the WTC and was rendered
unusable for nearly 15 days, has served as one of the truly incredible
stories that kept the entire global financial network from total chaos.
Our opportunity, for both Tampa and Florida, to capitalize on two key
points
- the presence of JPMorgan Chase Treasury Technologies in Tampa and this
Federal Reserve White Paper - are immense, and we are already beginning
to
see increased levels of activity directly related to these issues.
But that opportunity will require focused attention and resources to
become
fully realized, and part of that focus will come from the IT Center of
Excellence for Financial Services initiative that is now part of the
2003
Enterprise Florida Statewide Strategic Plan for Economic Development as
part
of a "competitive cluster" process. Tampa is being counted on to serve
in a
leadership capacity for this initiative, along with Enterprise Florida
and
IT Florida.  To that end, Irv Cohen has volunteered to chair the
initiative,
and we will provide support as required.  
In addition, EFI is now focusing for the first time on the Financial
Services sector as being key and critical to the Florida economy, and we
have provided the background and framework for developing that sector
based
on our success in Tampa/Hillsborough County. This has also been included
in
the 2003 EFI Statewide Strategic Plan for Economic Development.

I now you are hurting for money,so here's some help.
For the next 5 years make the homestead exemption for the next $25,000.00 ABOVE 
$5,000.00 value . This is going to improve property values, and have more 
people share in the expense of our govt. and  it's programs .
Then you could graduate it up to amount above $10,000.00 and so on.

border. Deputy Bob Tracy worked New Years Day with his son and my husband
and I loading the trailer again to fill the Sheriff's warehouse with books
and toys to be used year round in Lake county. Major Gnann was my contact
and was very cooperative and couldn't have been nicer. We had such an
overload of donations we were able to go to each police department,
advocacy center, GALP and ESS service center surrounding Lake county and
give them toys for kids. This gave me the chance to meet with the community
folks and gain input on social services issues. Now that I have purchased a
home in Tavares I look forward to assisting them with some of these local
issues in the coming months.
If extra money surfaces in the budget this year please consider using it to
clone this sheriff and his staff, they were the best. Their spirit of
community was exemplary and was demonstrated by every employee with which
we had contact.
Thank you so much for the opportunity to serve, and to meet these fine
folks.

Dear Governor:
I wanted to tell you how wonderful Warden Lehr of Central Florida Reception
Center was to work with this Holiday season. His staff, Officer Doug
Simmons, Lt. Adams and Lt. Leftwich all bent over backwards to assist me in
managing the huge donation NBC sent for the clients of Florida's DCF. They
accommodated us in every possible way, adjusting schedules, staying late
and bringing additional equipment. In small return, we were able to supply
them with toys for the inmates children when they visited for Christmas and
sent more for other visits during the year. The inmates were a pleasure to
work with and not one of them slacked off. Warden Lehr assisted us last
year as well and I can't thank him enough for his generosity.
Thank you for allowing me to serve our clients and for giving me the
opportunity to work with these fine folks.

Dear Governor,

Here is another example of what you spoke about this week.  As a well
trained lay leader, I serve as the volunteer Jewish chaplain at DCF's
Florida State Hospital for the Mentally Ill, 50 miles west of here in
Chattahoochee.  Obviously, and thankfully, not much call for me.  On
December 26, a 60 year old Jewish mental patient at the hospital died, no
family, no assets.  The paid DCF chaplain called me for advice and I, of
course, offered to officiate.  There were legal entanglements and finally
yesterday, Wednesday, January 8, we were able to have a funeral and burial.
Judaism usually moves much faster.  Inmates from a nearby prison had dug the
grave, some hospital staff came to the service, the paid chaplains were
wonderful and appreciative, and I ensured that the Jewish patient received a
Jewish funeral.  It was a sad situation, but I felt that I made it just a
little bit brighter.  The hospital director was not able to be there, but I
had met her before.  I believe that she is Ms. Diane James.  She is a very
caring person.  If you see her, please tell her about this funeral.

Best wishes on your second term.

THE HONORABLE JEB BUSH 
GOVERNOR FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA 

Dear Governor Bush 

Florida Today Newspaper, Melbourne, Fl. reported today that Brevard County Sheriff Williams is under consideration for appointment as a Circuit Court Judge, 18th Judicial Circuit. In the event Sheriff Williams is selected as a Circuit Court Judge I respectfully recommend that you appoint J. R. (Jack) PARKER as Sheriff for Brevard County. 

I am a retired Special Agent, FBI and during the past several years operated my own business in Central Florida. I have had the pleasure of both a professional and personal association with Jack Parker for a number of years. Jack has an impressive background in law enforcement service to our community. His service with the Sheriff's Office included Command Staff Positions and he was a Commander when  selected for his current position, Director of Public Safety for Brevard County Florida. 
Jack manages the largest department in our county with 700 employees and a 52 million annual operating budget. 

Jack Parker is a highly intelligent professional who is extremely well qualified and posses thoes rare special abilities of leadership. Jack would be an excellent Sheriff for Brevard County. I would appreciate if you would favorably consider my recommendation of Jack Parker for Sheriff of Brevard County. 

Thank You for your consideration in this matter. 

Your loyal supporter,

Hi Ruth,
I'm afraid I did not receive the letter you mentioned. If can try to e-mail
it to me again, I will be glad to share it with the other stakeholders. 
                                   
Please be assured that we are doing everything possible to try to ensure the
most appropriate services for your son. I personally met with Susan
Dickerson yesterday to discuss your current situation. Based on our
discussion, the primary issue with your service request is more than one
service is being requested at the same time for your son. If you believe
this information is incorrect please let me know or you can also call Susan
directly. We are very sensitive to the fact that you and your husband have
the daunting task of trying to access health care for both your son and
daughter with autism. Although we cannot provide services to your daughter
until she is no longer on the waiting list and enrolled in the waiver
program, we are reviewing her current status to project when we may be able
to begin services.
                         
 I realize this does not address your immediate situation, but hope it
provides you with a some reassurance that all possible options are being
explored to try to help you and your family. I would also like to take this
opportunity to thank you again for your continued involvement and commitment
in our stakeholder group. It is critical that  families, such as yours, who
are caring for more than one child with a disability are a part of policy
decision making to redesign the current  program, including the prior
authorization process.            
I will be out of town on business the rest of the week, but please don't
hesitate to contact me if you would like to discuss your concerns further.

Very sincerely,
Shelly

Did 
you ever receive it? My computer has been working poorly lately so I never 
know what's up. 
  I continue to be frustrated with a lack of response from Maximus or DCF 
about termination of my Son's PCA/Respite services under Med. Waiver. It has

been made clear to me that many people are having to go to Fair hearing and 
those who are unable to afford legal defense are loosing. What will I do if 
Ihave no help in my home? Who will care for me when I am unable to care for 
my kids? I know this is not the reason that Maximus was brought into this 
State. You are a person who has made DCF/ACHA approachable. I'm here to tell

you that Maximus is a faceless entity, to consumers they are numbers 
crunchers.caring only about figures and not about the people that are behind

the number. To them my beautiful Son is 154 54 42-41. 
 Shelly it is VERY scary out here for those of us living on the edge. People

are coming to me and wanting to know how many hours I have and why they
chose 
me to audit.......I don't know what to tell them. I don't know why myself!

Subject:	Record 95 manatees killed by boaters in Florida in '02

From: K Green

Not a job well done!

--------------------
Record 95 manatees killed by boaters in Florida in '02 
--------------------

By David Fleshler
Staff Writer

January 9, 2003

A record 95 manatees were killed by watercraft in Florida in 2002, during a time of bitter fights over measures to protect the huge marine mammals.

The deaths represent a sharp increase from the 81 manatees killed the previous year, according to a state report released Wednesday. The largest number of deaths took place in Brevard and Lee counties, the scenes of disputes over restrictions on boating and dock-building.

David Arnold, the state's chief of protected species management, blamed irresponsible boaters and bad luck for the deaths. He said the state would investigate why watercraft-related deaths increased sharply in certain areas, such as Palm Beach County, where the number of manatees killed by watercraft jumped from three in 2001 to six last year. Three were killed by watercraft in Broward County, down from four the year before.

Arnold said the number of manatees killed by watercraft may come down next year, because the state and federal governments have created restricted-boating areas. In Brevard, where watercraft killed 17 manatees last year, a new manatee-protection zone just went into effect.

"I would like to think that what we're doing will make a difference," he said.

The report found that the number of deaths overall declined from 325 in 2001 to 305 last year. But the increase in deaths from watercrafts is certain to be invoked in the fights swirling around the manatee.

Federal wildlife officials are trying to restrict the construction of docks and marinas in southwest Florida to protect manatees, a move that Gov. Jeb Bush said would have a disastrous economic effect. Environmental groups have sued to force the state and federal governments to designate more slow-speed zones for manatees. And on Jan. 23, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is to vote whether to downgrade the manatee's status from endangered to threatened.

"We certainly think that the manatee needs all the protection it can get," said Judith Vallee, executive director of the Save the Manatee Club. "This is no time to even consider downlisting, when we're losing so many manatees, not only to boat collisions, but there are so many manatees dying in Florida waters from all causes."

Ted Forsgren, executive director of the Coastal Conservation Association of Florida, a fishing group that opposes increased manatee protection, cautioned against drawing the wrong conclusion from a single statistic. All the evidence shows that the manatee population has grown over the past 45 years, and the number of deaths from collision is more evidence that the animals are widespread, he said.

"I honestly believe that the number of watercraft deaths is going to go down only if the number of animals declines," he said.

The latest aerial counts found more than 3,200 manatees in state waters, a record. Collisions with watercraft accounted for the largest number of deaths, followed by deaths by natural causes, the deaths of baby manatees and deaths from cold.

Dear Governor Bush,

 My name is Randy Arieux, and I have been a Deputy Sheriff for the past 25 years with the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office.

  I am writing this letter in reference to the possibility of you appointing an intern Sheriff for Brevard County. As reported by the Florida Today Newspaper, Sheriff Williams may seek a Governor’s Appointment for a judgeship to further his career in the judicial system. Sheriff Williams has worked hard for the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office as well other  high-risk personnel throughout the state of Florida through his work in Tallahassee with the three percent high hazard retirement system. For this I thank him.

 It is further understood that if Sheriff Williams is appointed, Jack Parker, Director of Brevard County Public Safety, is one of your considerations for the internship as Sheriff. I have personally know Director Parker for many years , as a member of the Brevard County Sheriff’s office and through his work as Director of  Brevard County Public Safety. Director Parker is well liked and respected throughout the county. His leadership ability is “Second to None”. Director Parker is a person I look up to and yet speak to as a friend. 

 I feel, if appointed as Sheriff, Director Parker will serve you, the employees of the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office and most importantly the citizens of Brevard County Sheriff with the highest of standards.

 In closing I would like to congratulate you on your re-election as our Governor of Florida. 

 Thank you,  Randolph J. Arieux

Governor Bush,

My name is Bill Farmer and I am the Fire Chief for Brevard County.  But, I am writing to you today as an individual.  I state my position so you may understand why I know what kind of an impact Jack Parker can have on an organization.

In the local section of the Today paper there was an article indicating that Sheriff Phil Williams may be seeking an appointment to a judgeship.  Should you choose to appoint the Honorable Sheriff to this position I believe you would be given another opportunity, the appointment of a new Sheriff.

In your enviable position of not having to consider re-election you only need to consider your legacy; and for Brevard County that may well mean the selection of our next Sheriff.  I cannot think of any other singular local elected official who has a greater impact to a community.  For this reason you will want to select a person who is community based, well educated, well respected by both civil and uniformed personnel, has managed a multi-million dollar public sector budget, and it wouldn't be a bad thing if he was a good republican too.

Jack Parker is that person.  

I have worked with him for over five (5) years now:

IMPROVING THE AGENCY:

During those five (5) years under his partnership, mentoring and guidance Brevard County Fire Rescue has enhanced its medical capabilities ensuring that every citizen living in unincorporated Brevard County has access to Advanced Life Support.  The agency has a response time to emergencies five (5) minutes faster than the nationally recommended response time and has equipment (and more importantly a continuing plan) which is modern and yet cost efficient.

He spearheaded the expansion of our Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system into central Brevard County.  In essence he was responsible for the management of the expansion of an agency answering approximately 24,000, 911 EMS calls with ten (10) ambulances to an agency answering 40,000+, 911 EMS calls with twenty-three (23) ambulances.

PERSONNEL:

Employee participation in the managing of the agency has also been increased.  Employees routinely provide committee input to the equipment they utilize and the stations they live in.  Yet, accountability has also been increased.


He led the agency into creating an Employee Awards program, recognizing those employees who do the job well, who go the extra mile, and who pull the community together.

EMERGENCY EXPERIENCE:

During his tenure with Brevard County Fire Rescue he has been the Public Safety Director during the worse natural disaster to strike Brevard County, the 1998 Fire Storm.  During this event Mr. Parker interacted with both local, state and federal officials ensuring that the citizens of Brevard County had a county official who was accountable.  Because of his leadership more than 800 homes were saved that would have been lost.

Further, because of his interaction with state officials, keeping the State Fire Marshal's office and the Governor's office informed of the conditions of the fire storm, Mr. Parker was instrumental in bringing specialized firefighting equipment to the line firefighters.

Additionally, he has Emergency Management/Emergency Operations Center (EOC) experience dealing with hurricanes, tornados and other natural, man-made and terrorist disasters.  Mr. Parker knows how Brevard County's Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan works.  He can function as the Sheriff in the EOC's Policy group the day after you appoint him should Brevard County be struck by a natural, man-made or terrorist disaster.  There is no lead time, and he knows all the players.  

As a certified law enforcement officer and a state certified firefighter he can interact across all of the "empires".  He is well known and respected by both the law enforcement and firefighting communities within Brevard.

Please consider the above.  In short, the firefighters respect him, the cops respect him.  He has worked as a Deputy, as a Corrections Officer and Sheriff Commander in Brevard.  He has command experience both on the law enforcement and fire sides of the house.  He has managed a public sector 40+ million dollar budget.  He has recognized community needs and addressed them.  Your opportunity to ensure that Brevard County is safe during these insecure times is now.  

Governor Bush, the choice is obviously yours.  Jack Parker is the man to be Sheriff and he'll be a credit to your legacy.

Please feel free to e-mail me if I can answer any questions or be of any assistance.

Governor Bush,

I work as an assistant county attorney in Brevard County.  However, I write to you now as an individual.  My employment with the Brevard County is important in understanding the basis of the opinion I would like to convey to you.

Given the statement of Sheriff Phil Willliams in a local newspaper today, it appears you may have an opportunity to appoint someone to the position of the Brevard County Sheriff should you appoint Sheriff Williams to the position of Circuit Judge.  

Jack Parker is the person you should appoint to the position of Brevard County Sheriff should the opportunity arise.  I have known and worked with Jack for over 15 years...working with him on many legal issues - from the time he worked under Sheriff Jake Miller as an Assistant Commander at the jail, later as a Commander with the Sheriffs Office,  up until now as the Director of the Public Safety Department for Brevard County.   

He has the respect of the law enforcement community and of the Board of County Commissioners.  He has knowledge of the Sheriff's Department, of the challenges it faces, of the budgetary issues,  of management and organizational skills which are badly needed in such organizations.

I do not think you could find an individual more dedicated to the welfare of this County or to the welfare of the Sheriff's Office as an organization.  Nor could you find anyone who would work harder or more diligently to ensure he was a credit to you and deserving of the trust you placed in him by such an appointment.

I could go on for much longer, but I won't.  You have many other issues to consider and Emails.  I would be happy to answer any questions.

In sum, quite simply, Jack Parker is the right person for the job.

Jeb,
 
I am a loyal republican and business owner in Brevard County Florida.  I worked years ago for your father and Bill Bennett in the war on drugs.  After Clinton killed all our program to fund midnight basketball I started my own business fixing computer networks here in Brevard County.  Today I employ 9 people and hope to create many more jobs.   I grew up here, this is my home.  I have known Jack Parker for over 30 years and know him to be a man of his word, an experienced politician, an experienced lawman, a fine republican, a fine man.  I know Randy Ball as only a politician!  
 
I like many others here would rather see Jack as Sheriff than Mr Ball!!  The current sheriff is a lawyer and former democrat who switched sides for the votes.  All he has done since his election is raise the budget!  Jack was commander, number two man under our former sheriff Jake Miller a lifetime republican, and one of the finest men I have ever known.  If that does not qualify him for sheriff I don't know what does.
 
Thanks you very much for your time, and thank you for sticking it out here for all  of us!!  Tell your father I truly enjoyed supporting his efforts and respect him as one of the finest presidents we have ever had!!
 
Sincerely
 
Keith Shook

Greetings,
I'm writing about Florida's attempts to comply with the No Child Left Behind law. We're way ahead of most states with our testing and accountability program.
The tricky part is the requirement that we hold schools accountable for the performance of subgroups defined by race and ethnicity. The feds want us to look and see how Hispanic kids and African American kids at each school performed and hold the schools' collective feet to the fire if those kids are lagging behind. 
That's a little different from our system. Though we look at the performance of the lowest quartile, and we publicize disaggregated data, we have a color-blind accountability system.
DOE tells me we have no plans to do any serious tinkering with our current accountability system, but that we might overlay the federal system so we can comply. I guess that means it will be possible for a school to avoid an F from the state, but still be failing in the eyes of the feds. Won't that be confusing?
Should Florida introduce race as a factor in its school accountability system? Are we willing to change our accountability system - again? Or can we have a sort of a two-tiered system without confusing parents?
Just wondering.
I'm working to get John Winn on the phone. So far it has been easier to get Rod Paige on the phone. (He says Florida is just great, but that Texas is better. Go figure.)

Dear Governor Bush,
I am writing to request that you and your staff consider a way to compensate primary (K-2) schools under the A+ Plan.  
 
Since Holley-Navarre Primary School opened in 1994, there has been great emphasis placed on high achievement.  Since the A+ program began, the intermediate school has been capitalizing on the excellent foundation we lay for the children that take the FCAT.  They have been rewarded every year that the program has existed.  We have been their only feeder school the entire time. 
 
We have recently become aware that our district does not qualify for extra funding for “No Child Left Behind” because we are above the criteria set.  Our school does not receive any Title I funding because our percentage of free/reduced lunch children is near 30%.  We have difficulty earning grants because it is difficult to demonstrate a need.  We are concerned that we may begin to lag behind other schools because we do not have access to the same resources the other schools have.  Our school is the ideal that the A+ School Plan is attempting to reach, but it takes capital to maintain.  Our School Advisory Council is well aware of this, and is looking for ways to maintain, and preferably improve our standing.
 
A fair solution would seem to be that for the purposes of allocating A+ money that we were considered to be a part of the intermediate school.  Since K-5 schools receive the reward based upon FCAT scores and other criteria, it would seem that funding for our K-2 could be based on the intermediate’s 3-5 FCAT scores, as long as we met the other criteria.  As I mentioned above, we are the only feeder school. 
 
The current plan seems to discourage the primary-intermediate school model.  Although we have been offered the option of becoming a K-5 school, our School Advisory Council, our parents, and our staff do not favor it.  We believe we have optimal conditions for preparing children for the next level.  Any benefits we would receive from A+ money would be offset by the problems we would inherit.  
 
Finally, you are invited to visit our school, and hear from our School Advisory Council.  We believe you will see the high quality program we offer, and the need to remain “cutting edge”.  Thank you for your consideration of this matter that is very important to all of us.

We are writing this email to thank you for listening and acting upon our request.  We just received a phone call from the DCF telling us that we have been finally approved for the adoption of our son.  We cannot begin to tell you how grateful we are that this phase of the process is over and that we can begin the work of raising our family in peace.
We would like to think that we are the only ones that have found themselves in this predicament with the DCF.  Unfortunately we know of too many cases that are tied up in similar red tape.  Please be assured that we believe wholeheartedly in your leadership and that with your guidance and the work of those you have placed in positions around you this whole Department can be turned into a strong arm for the good and for the true welfare of the children and the community as a whole.

Governor,

I can't thank you enough on behalf of all my colleagues for yesterday's meeting.  Hope I wasn't too heavy handed as our "spokesman," but it is a big group...We came away with a strong sense of your grasp of our issues and commitment to the mission of our system.  We have scheduled a discussion of the reading issue, and your suggestion of a reading "endorsement" for child care workers in particular.  We're on the team...

If I understood you correctly at the conclusion of the meeting, I'll look for a call in the next week or so.

On a personal note, thanks for the Board appointments. Superintendent Blocker and I are well into discussions on how we can collaborate to solve some of the tremendous challenges we face together.  His membership on our Board is a powerful symbol and a much more than symbolic connection between our institutions. Lew Oliver has a keen sense of business strategy and is an eager advocate for our mission already.

When your schedule permits, we'd love to spend a couple of hours with you here in Orlando with the CEOs of our hospitals, our trustees, and a couple of others to share how we are addressing the nursing shortage, our facility issues, and other challenges.

Sir:

We met earlier when I was the installation commander at Hurlburt Field (Fort
Walton Beach) -- several times actually during our military installation
commander gatherings around the state, and one time in your office for
photos after a Kosovo  resolution was read on the floor ... I've since moved
on to another command in Little Rock, Arkansas, but still have a home in
Florida and remain a constituent & Gator fan ...

Recently our troops began planning an event and told me they'd like to
invite former President Bush as a guest speaker ... as we began the process
of sending an invitation to your father, I remembered the first time I met
him in Germany, and wanted to pass the vignette on to you ...

Your Dad was Vice President at the time and had stopped for fuel at Rhein
Main enroute to Moscow for a state funeral ... several of us were having a
promotion party in the Officer's Club that night, and heard he was sitting
alone in the dining room nearby having a bite to eat while the airplane was
being serviced ... I passed a note on a bar napkin via the waitress inviting
him to join the party ... we were a common waypoint for VIPs in those days,
and although most of them preferred to be left alone, I thought that maybe a
Navy flier would be game to join us for a few moments ...

within 5 minutes the Vice President appeared, congratuated all of us on the
promotion, then stepped up on the bandstand and spoke with the crowd ...
many pictures were taken that night and they remain proudly displayed on
many walls ... he seemed genuinely happy to be included -- to be among the
"fraternity" of aviators once again, and everyone saw his comfort and
association in his eyes and words ... a small event that I'm sure he would
never remember, but for every military person who was there that night
something important happened -- thier service became more meaningful because
here was a flier among them who had served when needed, and here was the
Vice President of the United States who thought we were important enough to
spend some time with ...

your Dad was (and still is) a great leader and a great guy (guess that runs
in the family) ...

best of luck to you in the challenges ahead, and thanks to you and your
entire family for your public service and support of all those who are now
at work in our nation's military forces ...

Subject:	Florida's Education Reform & Savings

Dear Governor Bush,
 
RE:  Suggestion for Florida's Education Reform & Protection of Children
 
In an effort to save money, reduce Florida's liability and protect children from harmful propaganda, please propose that the entire "sex education" curriculum be eliminated in Florida.   It is through "sex education" that many controversial and potentially detrimental issues are introduced to students in the name of diversity, sensitivity, safety, etc.  
 
The time is right to get the state of Florida out of the "sex education" business.  It is the parents' job!  I understand the Florida Education Legislation says that abstinence is to be taught as the preferred behavior until marriage and that marriage consists of a relationship between one woman and one man.  However, this is not what is truly being taught.
 
Please consider proposing the removal of "sex education" curriculum as one means of reducing costs and avoiding potentially huge legal liability since Florida is needing to cut costs and liabilities in an effort to enact the class size reduction amendment.
 
As you may remember I ran for a position on the Broward School Board unsuccessfully but am still very much involved.  In December I was appointed by a School Board member to the Broward Diversity Committee and the liberal media is having a fit over it!  The media continue to try to portray myself and any others that dare oppose the homosexual agenda in schools, such as the GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian, Straight Education Network) Partnership as evil, hateful bigots, etc.  I dare to tell the truth and expose the misrepresentations that homosexual activists make in their relentless effort to infiltrate the Education System with the "sexual orientation" propaganda.  Please help us protect the innocent children.  NONE are born gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered as they claim.  
 
I have been invited to the Martin Luther King prayer breakfast by my friends, Dr. O'Neal & Leketia Dozier.  I look forward to seeing you then. 
 
Perhaps you can put me in touch with the proper people in the Education Department and get this idea moving.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Congratulations on your re-election!  It is my understanding that you will be appointing a new Supervisor of Elections for Hillsborough County in the near future.  I would like to recommend that you consider Irene Guy for this position.  It has been my pleasure to work with Ms. Guy at Verizon for several years where I have observed her managerial skills and political abilities.  I believe that she would be an excellent Supervisor of Elections and she would be an asset to Hillsborough County.

Dear Governor, 

      One more question.  The environmental community treated you so shabbily before the election.  The Hispanic residents of the 8.5 Square Mile Area supported you and would do anything for you.  They really believed that you would stand up against this injustice and get the levee that a Democratic Congressman had promised in 1989.  Yet, if the rumors are true, you are rewarding the environmental community who treated you shabbily at the truly great expense of those who revered and stood by you.  Why would you do this? It truly baffles me. I have an e-mail from the Corps that says 77 residences will have to be removed by the 6(d) plan and I was told that there are at least 19 businesses.  I hope that it is merely because you are not being given the facts that you would choose the plan of those who treated you badly over the interests of this rural Hispanic community.  The interesting thing is that  Congressman Dante B. Fascell who supported them in the past was a liberal Democrat with no penchant for private property rights.  He supported the original plan to protect the 8.5 SMA because he thought it was good for the Everglades.  He was right. 

God Bless You,

Dear Mr. Bush, 

Hope you are well and that the New Year has brought you and your family much health. 

Forgive me for the intrusion of writing this email to you but I am beginning to get nervous and almost desparate about what is currently happening in my life.

My husband and I met three years ago in Mexico while I was working there on an event for Disney.  We married in the beautiful city of Oaxaca, Mexico on November 23, 2001.  I have submitted for my husband the I-130 and the 

I-129F from the U.S.  He has never been to the States and has never applied for a tourist visa, therefore, the only way he can come is with the approval of any one of these two visas.  We are now expecting our first child in April of this year.  I have not heard from Immigration at all in regards to the status other than having received their receipt notices.  

Next month I will enter my last trimester and I will not be able to travel to visit my husband anymore.  In planning for my delivery, my closest relative is 3.5 hours away and I only get 6 - 8 weeks of maternity leave from work.  Although having a family was our choice, we want to do this correctly - AS A FAMILY - and having someone close to me during my last months of pregnancy is important, as well as having someone who I trust 100% help me care for our child when I return to work.

I understand that Immigration in the US has taken a complete turn.  I do understand.  But this is my first child and being far from my husband and or family makes the last few months difficult to handle.  I am fortunate that at the moment my pregnancy is going well and that I can continue to work.  I am greatful for what I have, but my husband and I married because we wanted to be together for the rest of our lives and have a family as a family, together, and not thousands of miles apart.

Is there anything that you suggest I do?  Anyone that I can contact?  Anyone else that I can write to?  ANY assistance or guidance that you can give me will be much appreciated.

Below I detail the information regarding my petitions for my husband.  Again, I apologize for the intrusion but as a father and a family man I hope you understand my situation.  

Thank you for your time and patience,

on number three, Senator Dudley was trying to go beyond the call of duty, I imagine, but it was not necessary. On number one, I believe the state is obliged to build the system over time. My position is that this plan should be viable financially. We should know as taxpayers what the cost to the state will be. They should be fixed and the private sector should take the risk of success or failure. The private sector should invest in the project at a level that shows commitment. If this happens, then I would support the high speed rail project. If it doesn't, I will ask the legislature to rescind the amendment.

    Gov. Bush:
    Thanks for taking the time to reply. It was a nice change from the ususal deluge of e-mails asking me to refinance my mortgage or invest in some Ivory Coast get-rich quick scheme.
    I plan on writing a story and, at the risk of wearing out my virtual welcome, wanted to ask a couple follow-ups:
 

1) Do you believe the state is absolutley required to build the system? Chairman Dudley has said construction is "subject to" the legislature making the money available. He said, though, that the rail amendment doesn't force lawmakers to do so. Is that your reading as well? And, if it is, will you work to prevent the system from being built?
 
2) Chairman Dudley has suggested that rail board members make a final recommendation without knowing which route through Central Florida they were selecting. Making the decision "blind," the chairman says, would focus only on the bottom line and eliminate any concern about the lobbying of his son and daughter-in-law. What are your thoughts about  this "blind" selection process? Is it worth considering or does it pose too many problems?
 
3) While it's true there is no legal conflict, Chairman Dudley proposed the "blind" recommendation process, in part, to eliminate any questions about his family connections. Doesn't that suggest there is an appearance problem the authority and the state needs to deal with?
 
Thanks in advance,
Jim Stratton

No I was not aware of Fred's childrens' interest. No I have not discussed their relationship with their dad with them or with him.  I have not been lobbied by either of them who by the way are adults and not children. No, I am not concerned about their  involvement as it relates to the Chairman since there is no conflict. Chairman Dudley should not disown his children. Jeez, in your world of conflict, one is representing Disney, one is representing Universal ... this is biblical, Read the bible for the answer or better yet, you should recognize that the process will be fair and focused on what is best for Florida's taxpayers. 
 
The bigger story is how much this initiative will cost taxpayers? How much risk will the taxpayers through the state  have to take? What is the all end cost (not just from Orlando to Tampa) and what are the benefits to Floridians? There are so many unanswered questions ...... That should be the story. I intend to focus my interest on these questions  the answer of which could cost billions and the loss of public transportation dollars for Cental Florida and the rest of the state. I will not worry about the  possibility of the perception of the possibility of the perception of conflict that seems to be the common interest of the day in journalism.
 
Onward.

Gov. Bush, 
Good Morning. 
My name is Jim Stratton, and I'm the transportation reporter for the Orlando Sentinel. I've written two stories recently about high-speed rail Chairman Fred Dudley and his family connections to lobbyists working for Disney and Universal.

The chairman's son is a Disney lobbyist and his daughter-in-law is a Universal lobbyist. While neither has been a key figure in their companies' rail lobbying efforts, both have played a role.

This has raised some questions about Chairman Dudley's ability to make an objective decision. At the least, some have suggested it creates the appearance of a conflict. I wanted to write you to find out:

-- Were you aware of the Dudley family ties? 
-- Have you discussed those relationships with Chairman Dudley or anyone else? 
-- Are you concerned the family connections present the appearance of a conflict? 
-- What, if anything, do you feel Chairman Dudley should do to resolve the issue? 
And while I have your ear, let me shift gears quickly. 
Given the problems the Lynx transit agency has had in the last few months, do you plan on asking any of your appointees to that step down? If not, do you plan on reappointing them?

Governor Jeb Bush
Governor, State of Florida

Dear Governor Bush:

   Last year, Tom Feeney appointed Surfside Mayor Paul Novack to the
Miami-Dade County Public School District Oversight Board.  Since his
appointment, Novack has been relentless in trying to get to the bottom of
the problems within the School District that are preventing Miami-Dade
County students from getting a decent education and actually placing them in
danger by failing to meet minimum safety standards.  

   Novack has uncovered a billion unspent dollars languishing in the
school's budget while badly needed new schools fail to come out of the
ground.  Even more disturbing are allegations in the news that new schools
have problems with leaking and mold due to faulty construction by
contractors and a lack of supervision by the District.  Taxpayer money is
wasted and these school contractors are laughing all the way to the bank. 

   This excessive waste of our resources combined with the lackadaisical
approach to managing our public schools is out of control.  News report
after news report has exposed the School District's incompetence and lack of
direction, yet denial and evasions of responsibility seem to be the only
result.  Your continued vigilance is required to effect any substantial
change in this process.  
   
Sincerely,

Subject: Educator Input


I mentioned this to you before, but it came up again when I was 
around several educators yesterday at the principals' meeting and in 
the community over the last several days.  There is going to be a 
large, very large number of educators leaving the profession on DROP, 
some this year and many more in the next two.  Many of them are in 
their early 50's, can't turn away from the lump sum to be received, 
but are not wanting to leave the profession.  Isn't there any way to 
amend, waive, whatever some of the requirements so that these 
exceptionally talented educators can stay on in some capacity?  We 
will be losing the "cream of the crop" in many instances.
We are in a crisis mode seeking educators who are talented, 
certified, and motivated.  This group leaving is going to leave a 
void that we cannot fill in the urgent timeframe we face.

Idea number two which is one I have brought up in other circles on an 
informal basis:  The Colleges of Education in the state have revamped 
their programs in the last few years out of necessity (FSU's Physical 
Ed. and Music being two with which I am most familiar, even their 
science)  .   They need to continue to revamp.   We are constantly 
working with them in providing the training ground for their interns. 
Locally, even TCC is sending out pre-interns.  What a wealth of 
potential educators that is!  We have developed a co-teaching model 
in  my school, out of necessity, for class size attention and for 
subject area expertise.  The interns could easily assume more of a 
teacher role in a co-teaching model.   There should be a creative way 
to use these educational interns in addressing the needs of our 
schools and students while meeting their own experience needs.  How 
much better this would be than seeking those outside the profession 
to come in.  Teachers in the field may resent the fact that an 
individual (as has been proposed) can come in and assume a teaching 
role along side a certified teacher who has worked long and hard 
meeting all kinds of requirements to teach.  We need to have ALL 
educators in all educational facilities in the state working 
together.  I remain less than confident that those inside the 
legislature have a grasp of the challenges in the educational world 
in our state just now.  Teachers need to be handled with "kid gloves" 
in most cases if we are to get from them the very best for our 
students.  Another garbled message, but maybe some sense.

Just some ideas!  Donna

There are so many excellent people out there.  I know as a nurse if I did
not own my business I love that kind of work. I loved working in home
health. Your taking care of people in the community.
In the medicare home health model the socialworker is only called for
community resources - food stamps meals on wheels etc.
In this electronic age a nurse should be able to pick up the telephone
explain a situation to a social worker and have that person prepare a list
of resources.
I think the reason my psych home care program was so sucessfull is I treated
every medicare dollar like it was coming out my own bank account, created
measurable objectives but most importantly I created an environment for my
nurses - a cameraderie that we could depend on each other for help and
ideas. team meeting were every week and kept to one hour and half. We
presented every patient and tryed to figure out how to do even better for
them.
Most of my nurses were contract-they were paid for each visit and therefore
motivated to do a lot of visits.
I focused as the manager or director on supporting the team and the teams
job was to support each other and most importantly keep the patient in the
home.
These were psychiatric patients and mostly elderly and unless someone was
extremely harmful to themselves or others we would keep them in their house.
It was an incredible phenon that happened.
Patients were happy so therefore doctors were happy.
I give all the credit to an incredible caring group of nurses.

When I worked at South County I went in as a per dium staff and left as the
head nurse five years later. I implemented some incredible things - and made
great changes. when youwor withthese kids you have to think way out of the
box. I left not because of the kids but because after five eyars of having
bosses that let me do what I needed to do and supported me - one of the
social workers decided she knew what nurses should be doing and wanted an
iron hand. I don't iron hands. Life is not that concrete.
There are many people in the system that need to change and grow.
and as far as money goes --this is my philosophy. When you take a job you
know how much it pays.  So after you get the job you shouldn't be grumbling
about about how much youdon't get paid.
Its that simple
have a great day

Hi Govenor Jeb
I hope you had a nice vacation
Just a thought about DCF-did it ever occur to anyone to utilize
nurses-I'm
talking lpns and rns. not as a full time work force but per dium-then
you
don't have to pay for benifits. nurses are really a lot more adept at
dealing with kids and they could just pick upa caseload that they can
deal
with.it could be set up almost like a home health situation-nurses love
stuff like this. I worked with kids for five years at south county
mental
health and i think we got better results-surely better than a person
with a
bs in political science.
nurses are a lot more nuturing.
When i worked at south county I would clean out my sons room at xmas and
bring all his old skates and toys to the foster homes around here.
I went to neighborhoods where there were actually chalk drawing on the
road
where people had been killed.
just one other thing. There is this whole thing happening in Virginia
with
rescue. I've been writing for a while and you know I try to do this in a
very common sense way.
In Virginia some folks from the Humane scociety got the legislatures to
write all kinds of new rules and regss basically so they could continue
and
folks like me who do small time breed rescue had to pay enormous fees
for
every foster home.
I do pay (The state 150 a year to be a corporation and then to the dept
of
ag) but foster homes are basically just friends that you find to help-
the whole point is without boring is that there is this whole group of
very
radical people who do things (like the pregnant pig amendment) who
basically
have a very radical agenda.
I beleive we should all be helping each other -- but apparently some
folks
do not. I got a chewing out from a doctor at the humane society because
they
rescue all dogs (not really but they like to say they do) and I tried to
explain to her- that they could rescue as many of my breed as she wanted
but
if she sent people to me I could help refer them to trainers vets and
other
resources that would help them in keeping their pets.
we certainly do not need any new rules but what would be nice is if all
of
us could get along and help each other out towards a positive outcome.
thanks again and think about doing something very cool and radical for
dcf
that could work.

The reason for my writing is to renew my request that you give every consideration to granting a pardon to Daniel Green. In that regard it is my understanding that a proper request for clemency was delivered to the desk of Wendy Berger on or about December 30, 2002. Since making my first request I would like to add that I had occassion over the holidays to spend a considerable amount of time with Ryan. He is an outstanding young man in every area of his life and given the overall circumstances a pardon would certaintly be warranted. Thank you for your time.

Subject:	MESSAGE FROM MICHAEL MASANOFF - VICE CHAIR OF TRI-COUNTY COMMUNTER RAIL AUTHORITY - SOUTH FLORIDA REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY

Dear Jeb:

 As your appointee to the Tri-County Commuter Rail Authority, I am pleased to report to you that this year has been an exceptional one for Tri-Rail and regional transportation efforts.   Ridership is at an all time high and double tracking is proceeding on schedule – we expect to be able to add additional trains within the next six months.  We are planning direct connections to South Florida’s major seaports with an eye toward creating a state of the art intramodal transportation facility.  We have also been successful in supporting a critical step forward for regionalism and regional transportation: unanimous support from the county commissions and regional business community for transforming Tri-Rail into a Regional Transportation Authority with a dedicated funding source. 

 As you know, representatives of South Florida’s business communities are flying up to Tallahassee next week to participate in a legislative luncheon and discussion about the proposed Authority.  Spearheaded by the regional business community, the legislation and the proposed $ 2.00 user fee on vehicle registrations and renewals has received the unanimous endorsement of the Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Martin County Commissions. My understanding is that this legislation will be sponsored by the three legislative delegations chairs, Senator Geller and Representatives Garcia and Machek with the rest of the delegation supporting as co-sponsors.

I realize that your time is of the utmost importance and limited, however, the Regional Business Alliance will be hosting the luncheon (to which you are invited) on Wednesday, January 22 from 12:00 – 1:30 p.m. on the 22nd Floor of the Capitol.  The business community, and I personally, would greatly appreciate not only your support and endorsement but your active involvement in ensuring that this milestone of Tri-County cooperation is implemented under your leadership and that South Florida, and Florida, is positioned to maximize its efforts in Washington during this year’s reauthorization of TEA21.

 Again, it has been a personally rewarding and satisfying experience to serve on the Tri-Rail board. My fellow members have honored me by electing me to the position of Vice-Chair after serving less than one year.  It’s been a great year and the future holds great possibilities.  But we need your help and leadership to make the South Florida’s Regional Transportation Authority, and a better South Florida, a reality. 

 Thanks again for allowing me to play a small part in making Florida a better place to be.

 Best Regards,

 

   

Michael

Subject:	WSJ editorial

 
Read your comments in today's Wall Street Journal.
 
I totally agree that the solution is not more government workers, but rather depends on better parenting and better parents.  The problem is, our current system still rewards irresponsible behavior and has no real consequences to the parent if they raise irresponsible, uneducated children.      
 
I offer these totally politically incorrect (but likely effective) solutions:
 
1.   If a woman gets pregnant while receiving either state or federal income based benefits, all benefits should be cut off and she should be required to move into a group home with responsible supervision since she is obviously not responsible enough to avoid having a new child when she can't even afford to support those she already has.
 
2.   Create a program that rewards girls for not getting pregnant until they are at least 18, and have a full time job..    Through the school, you can notify girls from 6th grade up that if they abstain from having sex until they have graduated and get a job, they will get $25,000 reward.     (sounds like a lot but its far cheaper than what it costs to support a welfare momma and even one child.
 
3.    Require all recipients of any tax funded program  (medicaid, free lunch, etc) who is not working full time to be required to attend school to learn marketable skills.    No person feeding at the public trough, taking money that was earned by someone else, should be allowed to sit home while those forced by taxation to support her are working.    THERE SHOULD BE NO EXCEPTIONS.  Either they are working full time to qualify for benefits, or they are going to school to learn skills to get them self-sufficient.
 
Of course, expecting parasites feeding at the public trough to work or study as hard as those they are feeding off is probably just too politically incorrect .............. but the fact is, it is likely as companies like Wipro expand and provide greater and greater competition to high tech workers in America (read story in Fast Company magazine , 2/03 issue if you want a real eye opener), and as American companies try to compete for the business of American consumers and businesses .....    we need every single person who has not earned their retirement leisure time to be working,  or spending a full 40 hours a week learning skills so they can work.     IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN DEMOGRAPHICS, THE TIPPING POINT BETWEEN COLLAPSE AND SURVIVAL MAY BE JUST A FEW PERCENT MORE AMERICANS WORKING OR NOT.   (and if companies that have pension plans either need to put much more money in  (latest report is just the S&P 500 companies are $243 billion underfunded) which will result in lower earning, possibly lower dividends and likely lower stock prices, and if they can't swing that, many are talking of switch to cash balance plan which could lower income for future retirees by 10-30% .....).   WE NEED EVERY PHYSICALLY ABLE 21-60 YEAR TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT AND NOT A BURDEN TO HIS/HER FELLOW AMERICANS.
 
I wonder how long many americans will be asking something akin to "who is joh Galt?"

Subject:	Board of Dentistry Appointment

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
I will try to keep this brief as I know you have plenty to keep you busy. 
 
In regards to the most recent Board of Dentistry appointments I am shocked with one in particular
.
Dr. Carl Melzer is understandable, even though it would have been nice to have retained the sitting chair
.
Dr. Stanley Levsky is very bizarre to say the least.  The talk in the dental community is "who is he, how is he qualified and where is he?" I tried to call him to congratulate him on being appointed and try to get a line of communication started.
 
First, he is not employed by Taylor Correctional Institution. They referred my call to Manatee County Correctional Institution. He is not employed there. The number they gave to call was his home.
I did call his home only to be told he was not available and would get back with me last night or today. As of now I have not heard from him.
One of the periodontist called to state that she thought he was practicing dentistry in Illinois. In checking with the DOH his practice address is the same as the address he gave as his home on his application for Board appointment.
It is my understanding Dr. Levsky would need to be practicing dentistry in Florida for this appointment.
 
Dentist in Florida and members of the Florida Dental Association take the appointments to the Board of Dentistry seriously. When the Florida Dental Association gives endorsements for the Board, we do so with recommendations that they are some of the most ethical and highly respected members of our organization. Our reputation for serving the public is on the line and we do not want failures. 
 
I know there must have been a reason for this appointment, but from all I can gather there were certainly more well qualified dentists that could have served.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully you can give an indication as to why this appointment was made over others.

Subject:	High-speed rail

Gov. Jeb Bush,
You made the statement that it is 'Insane' to think of spending billions on high-speed rail service. The cost of the Orlando to Tampa leg is estimated to cost $1.5 billion. After the high-speed line is built, it will be used for many years. And to use the high-speed train, it is only necessary to buy a ticket. Here is another 'Insane' idea, Orange County wants to spend $2.5 billion to widen Interstate 4 and other roads. 
"Trying to cure traffic congestion by adding more capacity is like trying to cure obesity by loosening one's belt." In order to drive on our roads, a car is required. We have a problem in Orlando, and I suggest you read "Graying of suburbs hits home". As our population ages, the high-speed rail will be-
come more needed.

Subject:	Veteran's Day Should be a Holiday

Dear School Board Members,
 
I strongly support a school holiday in celebration of the federal Veterans Day.  
 
Any person who has served our country at the risk of their very lives deserves to be able to spend that day as they please by attending community celebrations, sleeping in late or spending free time with their family.  They have earned this respect for their service and sacrifice.
 
It is not for any others to determine the appropriate way for them to spend this national day of remembrance.
 
I speak as daughter of an Army Air Corp Pilot who was not fortunate enough to return from WWII and an army nurse who served in Europe.  My ex husband is also a Vietnam vet. 
 
Veteran's Day was always a time to both celebrate our blessings and remember our losses.  
 
You said you have received many e-mails against making this a holiday.  I wonder the rational behind this lack of consideration for veterans employed by the school district, and I believe we should get information about who has organized folks to protest a holiday for veterans.  
 
This is a very unusual position to take especially as so many young men and women are presently taking leave from their families to serve and protect our country.
 
This brings to mind the opposition of the last board when they were asked last year to honor a Lee Middle School teacher killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan.  
 
Please rethink this position, and support a paid holiday for Veterans Day.

She has broken no laws. Her only crime is that she is an African American, and elected by the people and not by the commissioners.  There have been other who have exceed their budgets and nothing was done.
 
Please look at the issues, there was no crime committed by the supervisor

Governor Bush, During our meeting on Monday, you asked me my opinion in regard to the local Supervisor of Election situation here in Broward County, and if my recollection serves me right, I stated to you that I support the rights of every citizen having the opportunity to vote without any level of disenfranchisement, and that the local SOE who was elected by the people may not have satified the full trust and level of competence based on the standards required by law to some citizens, but the direct attack is unfair and unwarranted. 

If there is legal violations, then without objections removal would be in order.  As I stated, my community understand and wants the best doing the best possible job and when that is not the case, we try to support to increase the required level of competence. 

This situation is at a boiling point, as I have just finished a phone-tree with individuals who have a grave concern with the County Commission here in Broward County giving Mrs. Oliphant a high noon mandate or they will seek removal. 

Call Me!

Jeb, 
Despite the outcrys and media overkill I am respectfully asking you to withold any action to remove Supervisor of Elections Miriam Oliphant. While some mistakes have been made - the county commission is doing everything possible to ensure that she can't do her job. I am asking that instead of pulling her at this time that you insert a mediator between her and the county commission. The impending election, if the truth be told isn't that difficult of a problem given cooler heads prevailing. Let's get Oliphant through the municipal elections. I think if we demonstrate every effort to help her and we incur problems in March - I would be the first to ask her to step aside - and I think she would listen. 
You, as governor have little to gain by being the guy who axed Miriam. A lot of this stuff is more hyperbole, egos and politics than anything I've ever seen.
By inserting a mediator to get us through an election next month and March we can work on cooling this thing down and working it out. The county commission doesn't want this to happen.
I've spoken to both Dorsey Miller and Alcee hastings about this mediation concept and they both think its a palatable way to resolve this issue. I'd like to talk to you about it further if you care. Dorsey's in Wash. DC but said he would call you.
If you wish to reach me you can contact me at (954) 345-1822 (office) or my cell at (954) 558-5139.

Hope all is well otherwise and wishing you well. Thanks for considering another point of view. I know you've had a lot of them.

Respectfully,

Keith Clayborne

For Immediate Release 
January 16, 2003 

University of Louisville enhances academic opportunities via distance and continuing education 

Business and IT certificate programs help develop value in technology career growth 

(Maitland, Fla. and Louisville, Ky. -- January 16, 2003) -- Four months into a technology agreement with a private, Florida-based corporation, the University of Louisville's Division of Distance and Continuing Education has already received a positive return on its investment to improve academic content and bolster economic development.

The university signed a five-year agreement last September with Collegis, the leading provider of comprehensive technology services to higher education. Collegis, based in suburban Orlando, Fla., works with the university in accordance with U. of L's strategic plan for revenue growth and enhanced academic opportunity by developing, marketing and sourcing students for certification programs in business and information technology (IT), such as those that lead to higher paying careers in the technology sector.

The corporation, with nearly 100 college and university clients nationwide, also provides content, instructional services, marketing and student recruitment services to help advance students in their careers and help generate increased exposure and revenues for the university. The U. of L program has been successful in its first four months of existence.

"We're pleased with the early development of this program and optimistic about the curriculum solutions we'll be able to provide to the greater Louisville community," said Gale Rhodes, director of the University of Louisville's Division of Distance and Continuing Education (DDCE). "This business relationship expands our offerings of real-world education programs that improve the career prospects of our students, and significantly enhances our ability to attract and retain those students."

The course offerings target adult learners, such as existing technology professionals and those individuals seeking to enter the IT profession, and include a wide range of industry-leading information technology programs and essential business courses that provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary to be successful in today's organizations. Corporations seeking flexible and expert training options for their employees are also drawn to the programs, which utilize a blend of technology tools and in-person instruction that allows the DDCE to create customized solutions that meet the specific needs of their corporate clientele. The opportunity to receive this training in the academic atmosphere provided by the university may spark increased enrollments, both in certificate and degree-granting programs.

"With the development of technology in so many areas of business, our students can turn to us for a leg up on instruction and career development," said Rhodes. "We'll continue to explore creative ways to reach our students and build a community of learners into a broader community of earners. That's what this Collegis relationship is all about and why U. of L's motto is 'Dare to be great.'"

When I described the scenerio during my response, I did express that if Ms Oliphant had to be removed for criminal activity that we encouraged an replacement as a proactive approach. 

Don't get me wrong, the African American community understands what's going on, and we want people rights to vote protected, we want Mrs. Oliphant or any other African American leader for that matter to cut the muster too. 

Likewise, we know she has made some mistakes, but not to the degree where a complete political destruction plan of her as a person is warranted.  If criminal violations have occurred, we as a people are first to say, its not acceptable and change is needed.   

But when local government sets a mandate for a high noon removal of an Constitutional Officer without jurisdiction is EGREGIOUS!

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Congratulations on your re-election.
 
As the regional representative of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, I would like to invite you to speak to a conference of journalists working in Spanish language media. The event will be held on Feb. 8, 2003 at the University of Miami in Coral Gables. We would be honored to have you as our keynote speaker.
 
The goal of the conference is to improve the quality and resources of Spanish language media, to ensure that the journalists in that field have opportunities available to them, and to ensure that they serve their readers and viewers well.
 
If you agree to speak, we would (of course) give you plenty of latitude in topic selection. Our only desire is that you deliver your remarks in Spanish. We could fit you in at any point in the schedule, but as things stand at the moment, the best time for us is at the end of the day, starting at about 4 p.m.
 
I would love to discuss the details with you or a representative. Please contact me at 954-356-4207.
 
Sincerely,
 
Rafael Olmeda

It was a good speech. As a dramatist and speechwriter, I was sitting there 
and felt the opportunity you had to grab the short hairs and CHOOSE when you 
decided to let go.
     A good speechwriter is first a competent anarchist--radically 
reformatting your ideas-- then, an alter ego who knows your cadence, speech 
pattern, and how to put them to good use; and when there's going to be no 
more discussion.
     As far as the speech was concerned, don't abandon Compassionate 
Conservatism for: there is no way government can solve the problem.
     Sounds good to evangelicals, but you lose a lot of Catholics with this 
viewpoint. CC is a progressive way to cut down the government's scope--and 
perhaps, encourage faith based initiatives.
     We have a plan to solve the Foster Care problem.
     Our Church has a residential Foster Home. The Board President,Dean 
Lovett (who gave at least 50K to your brother's campaign), and I wanted to 
make foster care into a process rather than run what amounts to an 
orphanage.
     We established the first Parents Anonymous Program in Florida where the 
birth parent--through our biblical counseling program and with added help as 
needed--would have an honest second chance,
     Then, we were setting up a method for trial adoption for members of our 
12,000 member church community. This in a sense is "sub" foster-parenting. 
With children that are no longer infants, this is the only way really to 
effect adoptions--to see if a child can mutually belong.
And the catalyst for the to happen has to be the Lord's love!
    This was beyond the scope and work habits of our Executive Director.
But I recommend it to you as a solution to the problem--not privitizing but 
focusing the resouces and programs of government on private means.
    It also shows a difference in outlook.Our Senior Pastor is delighted the 
children in the home are being saved one at a time.
Our board president is a businessman with the focus of results from solving 
a problem. I'm a Biblical Roman Catholic who stealthily thinks
the government is good for something!
    Thanks for reading this--after a long day. I have sent this foster care 
plan to Secretary Regier.
    Try some things you'll lose at--with bully pulpit--like how Florida 
should regulate  cell phones. Just throw it out there, Gin things up!
    Added you to my daily prayer list of brother Dean,Mark,Joe,
and my 15 year old,Patrick Jr.
                                                                         Pat

I made an appointment with him and he was kind enough to work me into his schedule.  Commissioner Horne and his staff ex[ressed enthusiasm at the possibility of  actually putting a significant number of  new teachers in the pipeline by the forthcoming school year.  We had an outstanding meeting and everyone walked away committed to executing the plan.

We are hopeful that an announcement can be made quickly!

Dear Senators, 

We are categorically opposed to Sen. Cowin's SB 178. 


As you know, Sen. Cowin has proposed an amendment to F.S. 419.001(2) which in addition to requiring a 1,000 foot separation between community residential homes for people with developmental disabilities, would require another 500 foot separation from any single family residence. 


As we have stated to Sen. Cowin, to distance a group home 500 feet from any single family residence in addition to distancing them from each other by 1,000 feet, would virtually ban them from single family residential areas and relegate them to the boon docks.  This step backwards reverses all progress we have made to integrate people with developmental disabilities into regular neighborhoods, to treat them as equals with all those inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that we cherish.  This bill also opposes President Bush's New Freedom Initiative, a comprehensive plan to tear down barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in community life. 


What is an intolerable situation is the movement to rule out the same opportunity of freedom of choice in housing whether it be in a typical neighborhood, a subdivision or a planned residential community. 


I would like to refer you to the Fair Housing Act and its intent to allow all individuals, regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap familial status or national origin, equal opportunity of choice of dwelling. 


In the recent decision by the District Court of Appeal of Florida, Second District (Case No. 2D01 - 4527) the court ruled that the enforcement of the restrictive covenants against group homes is discriminatory and contrary to state and federal law: 


In applying the terms of the FHAA, the federal courts have  determined that one may be guilty of discrimination in any one of three ways.  First, the Act prohibits intentional discriminatory conduct towards a handicapped person.  Second, the Act prohibits incidental discrimination, that is, an act that results in making property unavailable to a handicapped person.  Third, the Act prohibits an act that fails to make a reasonable accommodation that would allow a handicapped person the enjoyment of the chosen residence. . . . We are persuaded that, given the similarity of language and purpose in the federal and the Florida legislation, this three-pronged approach applies equally to the Florida Fair Housing Act.

I also refer you to Olmstead v Childs.  As stated by the court, each disabled person is entitled to treatment in the most integrated setting possible for that person. Additionally, President Bush's New Freedom Initiative is a comprehensive plan to tear down barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in community life. 

To quote one of the many voices we have heard in support of equality and freedom for people with developmental disabilities: 


I think of affirmative action, which has been in the news lately.  For individuals who have been discriminated against, for many years, the government's position was NOT to narrow the options for them.  No, it was the government's position to make possible what was not possible previously by opening up options and opportunities for those individuals. And then allowing those individuals to make choices.  -- Sue Cannon, Senior Education Specialist, Parent-to-Parent, Brevard County.

We have spent years in an effort to mainstream our children with developmental disabilities into the schools.  Now it is time to mainstream them into the community. 

I urge you to withdraw SB 178.

Good Morning, Jeb
       I hope this finds you well, and I'm sure hard at work, as usual.
       It is long past time to express my thoughts on the Miriam Oliphant fiasco in my county.  As the immediate past Chairman of the Senate Ethic and Elections Committee, I have stood by watching the mockery made of the carefully crafted revised election laws passed in 2001, and revisited and refined in 2002.  We worked diligently to address each of the reported problems that occurred during the 2000 elections.
       It appears one of her first actions following her election was to get rid of Sam Goren as the lawyer for the Supervisor of Election's Office.  Sam is one of the most ethical lawyers I have ever met!  He knew the Election Laws backward and forward, and she would have been well advised to have kept him.  Perhaps, she would not be facing some of her criticism she justly deserves today.  
       She is an attractive and charming lady, but she has been a total embarrassment to those of us who live in Broward.  Across the board, Democrats and Republicans, black and white, the comments are the same.  It is not a race issue, as some would have others believe, it is an incompetence issue.  Nowhere else in the state have we had the ongoing chaos, as we have experienced here in Broward County.
       She should have been removed following the Primary disaster in September 2002.  The hemorrhaging must stop, and soon.  Please help us.

Dear JEB,

Our county has the potential at this time to become very dysfunctional.  The reason for this is multi fold.  I know that you are aware of the "coup" that developed to unseat Margie as chairman, and the fact that they failed has really sparked "their" activities.  It is a very sad and stressful time for all of us, Margie included.  She is amazed at the behaviors of those who claim publicly to care about the Party
This group of individuals are trying to challenge and road block everything that she wants to do.  They are working with great efforts to build their coalition.  What can be done? It would be helpful if YOU phoned Margie and got the details from her, encourage her to be open and forthright.  Thanks for this opportunity...take care and God Bless..

RE:  BROWARD COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD vs. A.A.
       Manipulating the system of State Mediation

Dear Ms. Goff and Dr. Palazesi:

Once again, I feel obligated to communicate to you and to others in a supervisory capacity my experiences regarding the way in which School Boards continue to manipulate the system of State Mediation in Florida to continue to take advantage of parents of children and youth with disabilities.  You and others receiving this letter via electronic mail have the power to put a stop to this pattern and practice and to enforce the proper use of State Mediation, which would, undoubtedly, yield better educational results for children and youth with disabilities.  I have raised these issues with you in the past, but they continue to surface.

The State mediation conference held on January 15, 2003 in Broward County, Florida in the above mentioned case initiated by the Broward County School Board against A.A., not only failed to yield any agreement, but left the parents with even deeper wounds and with a clear understanding that the only reason why the Broward County School Board agreed to participate in State Mediation was just to "bully" them a little more.  More importantly, it left A.A., a second grader, whose gap in visual motor integration skills has grown to over two years of age, and which significantly impacts his access to education as manifested in his poor writing ability, without the related service of Occupational Therapy (OT) that he so desperately needs, and that his parents have been requesting since he was a preschooler.  The School Board of Broward County continues to deny him the related services that he is entitled to receive to benefit from special education.  It is important to understand that all of this is over Broward County School Board continuing to deny a second grader receiving special education services since the age of 3 with one hour a week of Occupational Therapy related services.  

Mediation began with the School Board bringing a surprise guest to the mediation conference, not included in the list previously provided from your office regarding the mediation participants.  As it was, the School Board had double the number of participants, including their surprise guest and the School Board Lawyer, Mr. Ed Marko.  Mr. Marko was quick to announce that none of the other participants representing the School Board were allowed to speak during the mediation conference and that he was the only lawyer who had ever litigated IDEA cases in Broward County, having litigated many of them.  He stated that the only individuals with authority to speak during the mediation conference were Ms. Grace McDonald, Due Process Coordinator, and himself, School Board Lawyer.  Indeed, Mr. Marko and Ms. McDonald were the only participants from the School Board who spoke during mediation.  Of course, this is contrary to the rules and against the spirit of participating in mediation in good faith, not to mention against the human spirit and against our constitutional right, which also extends to employees of the School Board, of freedom of speech.  

A telephone call initiated by me from my cellular telephone to Dr. Palazesi from the mediation conference, which was followed by a conversation between Dr. Palazesi and Mr. Rex Hart, mediator, resulted in Mr. Hart asking the surprise guest to wait outside of the mediation room.

Mr. Marko also insisted in forcing the parents to give up rights afforded to them under the "Procedural Safeguards for Exceptional Students", although Mr. Hart had announced at the beginning of the session, in accordance with the "Procedural Safeguards for Exceptional Students," that mediation was not used to waive any rights afforded to the parents or the student.  

At the end of the mediation conference, when no agreement was reached, Mr. Hart announced that he was destroying his notes.  Following the information written on Dr. Palazesi's letter establishing the "procedures for mediation," which reads, in pertinent part:  "Any notes taken during the mediation should be destroyed at the end of the session..."  I asked Mr. Hart if he was going to ask the other participants to destroy their notes as well, but he said that he had no power to do so.  I asked Mr. Marko, who had taken copious notes during the mediation conference, to destroy his notes, but he replied that he was not going to do so unless I had a ruling that required him to destroy his notes.  He added that as an attorney he found it inappropriate to destroy the notes that he had taken during mediation in a case that was pending a hearing.  I asked him:  "Are you then using this mediation session as a discovery tool?"  He answered:  "Unless you can perform a lobotomy on me."  

I, on the other hand, was happy to remain ethical and true to the mediation process and, abiding per the State mediation procedures, destroyed all the notes that I took during the mediation conference at the end of the mediation conference.  

Again, you and others in a supervisory capacity who are receiving this letter via electronic mail have the power to put a stop to this pattern and practice and to enforce the proper use of State Mediation.  We request and trust that you will do so, so that children and youth with disabilities and their parents can have access to a system of State Mediation as it was intended to be used: as a tool to "resolve disagreements relating to the identification, evaluation, educational placement, or the provision of a free appropriate public education..." to the child, and not  as a discovery tool for School Board Lawyers and as another opportunity to deny services to children while bullying their parents.  

A written reply is requested.

Dear Governor Bush:

Happy New Year. 

A lot has happened since I spoke to you last at the Family Care Counsel. On
April 15th, 2002 I suffered a medically induced heart attack because the
BCBS approved Physician I went to the day before patted me on the head and
said, "Everybody suffers Indigestion sometimes." The next day, in total
frustration, I went to my former doctor and in less then five minutes I was
in the Critical Cardiac Unit. The approved BCBS Physician had administered
about four times as much medication as needed. 

Last October I found out that my heart is fine now but to keep it that way I
need a better wheelchair, namely one with automatic elevating leg-rests and
reclining. After much searching and lots of measuring the permobil was
selected to be the best. Two physicians and one physical therapist wrote up
all the needed paperwork and we spent hours explaining the need to the
medical review team. 

BCBS came back with the finding that they would pay for the base of the
chair, the batteries, the armrests but not the seat or the leg-rests. The
DME provider and I argued for hours that it makes no sense to approve 4
wheels and a motor without the seat. That's a bit like buying a car with no
steering device. 

Thinking that they may have mistaken the term "base of the chair" as "basic
chair" we sent them a picture of their approved parts, to no avail.

I am still a Medicaid Waiver Provider and working full-time but unless I am
allowed to have a workable wheelchair that allows me to remain pain free I
may not be able to continue.

This is only the latest debacle with BCBS. Can your office assist with this
problem? 

I look forward to hearing from you again.

Sincerely,

Birgit Wilhelm

The people elected Ms Oliphant, the supervisor of Broward County elections, and they and only they should have the power and right to remove her.
 
I have not heard any call for a recall by the people.

Subject:	canker: fair, simple solutions

 
From what I can see, there are some basic facts about the citrus / canker issue:
1.  Citrus owners want to protect their source of personal income and wealth
2.  Back yard tree owners want to protect their free source of fruit and the value of their property
3.  The state wants to preserve a source of tax revenue 
 
I offer what I believe are two simple solutions that I believe are fair to all parties concerned:
 
1.   If citrus owners want to ensure the safety of their groves, and hence their income and wealth, a simple solution would be to create a 1900 foot "tree free "canker-break"  (like a fire break used to hald the progress of a fire)  around all their groves.  This could be accomplished either by either cutting down a 1900 foot "moat" of existing trees, buying up 1900 feet of land surrounding the groves, or paying homeowners who live within 1900 feet an annual fee to remain citrus tree free.
 
2.   Let grove owners who want to protect their groves create a "mature tree fund" that included mature trees and a cash fund to pay for cost of replacement referenced below.   (the state could protect its tax revenue from citrus  industry by providing a tax credit of some kind to partly offset cost to grow owners).  Since the only benefit of removing a healthy tree would be to protect the income and wealth of a "citrus industry member" and the taxes they pay, it should be required that the state make the injured party truly whole by replacing any healthy tree that is removed with one of comparable maturity and fruit bearing ability.    The "mature tree fund" referenced above, funded by the industry whose wealth and income is being protected, would be the source of the tree and funds to replant.     
 
THE ONLY REQUIREMENT ON PROPERTY OWNERS THAT MAKES SENSE IN THE INTERESTS OF "THE PUBLIC GOOD" IS A REQUIREMENT THAT ANY INFECTED TREE BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY.  
 
Both these solutions would provide a fair way for citrus industy members to protect their own income and wealth, while not depriving individual tree owners of their right to free fruit and property value protection.

Big Increases Projected for Military Space Spending (Source: Space News) 

The U.S. Air Force’s unclassified space budget could grow to roughly $20 billion annually by 2007, according to a Jan. 8 report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).  The 2003 Air Force budget included about $8 billion for unclassified space programs.  The report said defense spending overall could reach $408 billion by 2007, and $430 billion by the latter half of next decade. The current defense budget is $359 billion.

Florida Tech Attracts European Space Research Programs (Sources: Orlando Sentinel, Florida Today)

The European Space Agency (ESA) has sent more than 120 scientists, engineers, contractors and technicians to Florida Tech to prepare, monitor and run 16 biology experiments aboard this month's Space Shuttle science mission.  ESA is paying Florida Tech $800,000 to base its biology experiments there, and is providing opportunities for Florida Tech professors and students to participate in the research.  Among the ESA experiments: research into how bone cells add or absorb calcium in microgravity (research that applies directly to both osteoporosis and long space travel); how certain infectious bacteria multiply; and the influence of microgravity on radiation damage to DNA in human cells.  With a newly installed high-speed computer link between Florida Tech and KSC, the scientists will monitor and even control experiments onboard the shuttle from the university.

Web-Based Teacher Resources - Too Often, Educators' Online Links Lead To Nowhere (Source: TCEB)

It's one of those annoyances about the web that make some teachers wonder why they bother. After spending hours over the summer searching online for material to enhance their courses, then bookmarking the links on their computers or assembling them on class web sites, teachers later find that many of the links no longer work. "It's very frustrating-when you find a great activity, a web quest, or research, and you go to the web site and it's down," said Kelly L. Luton, who teaches Spanish at the 4,200-student Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax County, VA.  Support from a school technology coordinator and a library media specialist can greatly ease the burden of link checking. Those professionals sometimes have the skill to help the teacher "whack" an important site -- that is, make a copy of it so the teacher can use it off-line. 

Others call for government or education organizations or professional societies to start pooling resources in public digital libraries that are highly stable, so educators can depend on them. One such effort by the Arlington, VA-based National Science Teachers Association, for example, recruited 150 master science teachers over the past three years to spend parts of their summer collecting links for a special archive of science-related content for educators. The links selected by these so-called web watchers are organized in web guides categorized by grade level and scientific topic. The first eight web guides will be posted online at  <http://www.nsta.org> www.nsta.org and will be carefully maintained and gradually expanded, according to Tyson A. Brown, the manager of the program.  Target Marketing Inc. also maintains a non-profit directory of educationally focused websites at  <http://www.targetmarketing.org/course/> http://www.targetmarketing.org/course/. 

Teachers Protest Fee Charged For Teaching Out Of Their Field (Source: TCEB)

Louisiana is unfairly charging teachers $25 when they teach outside their area of expertise, education groups said. "It is extortion," said Julie Cherry, president of the East Baton Rouge Federation of Teachers. "We are already talking about people who are overworked and underpaid," Cherry said. "You don't have someone to fill their position but you are going to charge them for it? I think it is ridiculous." Teachers sometimes are assigned to classes outside their area of certification, or expertise, because of teacher shortages. For instance, an English teacher may be pressed into teaching a science class because of a lack of science teachers. "They have either voluntarily stepped forward to fill a void or have been assigned out of their fields involuntarily," Cherry's letter said. "They should not be penalized because of their professionalism and willingness to go the extra mile."

Roughly 7,500 of the state's 50,000 or so public classroom teachers are either uncertified or teaching outside their areas of expertise. Certified teachers have to earn a college education degree, finish with at least a 2.5 grade point average, and pass a national teacher exam. State officials said the $25 fee stems in part from new federal legislation designed to improve public schools. The measure is called the No Child Left Behind Act. One of the goals of the new law is that all teachers should be certified by the 2005-06 school year. That means the state has to heavily supervise those working outside their specialty, said Janet Reed, division director for state Teacher Standards, Assessment and Certification. "We can't do that if we don't know who they are," Reed said. Reed said the $25 fee helps finance the cost for state officials to evaluate the transcripts of those teaching outside their area of certification, technical assistance so those teachers can win certification in their new subject, and other work.

Florida Ranks as Second Best State for Entrepreneurs (Sources: SGPB & MSN)

Florida is rated number two among the 50 states in a composite ranking of the business environment for entrepreneurs and small businesses.  The Microsoft bCentral rating is a compilation of two recent studies: Small Business Survival Index 2002:  Ranking the Policy Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation; and Entrepreneurial Hot Spots: The Best Places in America to Start and Grow a Company, 2001.  The "Survival Index" is a product of the Small Business Survival Committee, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., which quantifies government-imposed costs on businesses.  The "Entrepreneurial Hot Spots" were identified by Cognetics, a Massachusetts firm that researches America's fastest-growing small companies and measures entrepreneurial activity.  Tax issues predominated in the ranking factors, but other factors such as operating and labor costs also contributed to the South’s success.

Governors Urge Congress to Fund Support for Small Manufacturers (Source: SSTI)

The National Governors' Association (NGA) is urging leaders of the House and Senate Commerce-Justice-State (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittees "to maintain the federal government's share of support for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) in the fiscal year (FY) 2003 appropriations."  In a letter on behalf of the nation's governors, they point out that MEP is a partnership supported by states, federal government and small manufacturers. 
 
"Each partner benefits from the partnership and has a responsibility to maintain it. Neither the states nor the small manufacturers are capable of replacing a loss in federal funding for MEP," the governors say. "As our economy struggles to recover, MEP is needed more than ever. It plays an important role in our state and national economies that no other entity is likely to fulfill." 
 
MEP is a national network of centers with 400 offices across the country and Puerto Rico that provide technical assistance and business support services to American manufacturers. The program helps small and mid-sized manufacturers adopt new technologies, processes, and business practices. In FY 2000 alone, MEP clients reported that completed projects created or retained 25,000 jobs, increased or retained sales of $2.3 billion and saved $483 million in costs nationwide.  The letter to the appropriation leaders comes at a critical time. The Administration requested only $12.9 million for the $106.5 million program last February. Although MEP has bipartisan support in Congress, funding for the program remains undecided.

Tech Talkin' Govs 2003: The Inaugural, Budget, and State-of-the-State Addresses (Source: SSTI)
 
The states are facing their worst fiscal crises in more than 50 years — the latest combined deficit figures were a whopping $90 billion. It should not be lost on the governors the important role tech-based economic development plays in strengthening state and local economies through higher wage jobs and more competitive businesses. Do their speeches bear that out? 
 
During the past 10 days, inaugural addresses were given in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Wisconsin and Wyoming. State of the State speeches were made in California, Connecticut, Idaho, New York, North Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia. Governors in Colorado, North Dakota, Virginia, and Wyoming delivered budget messages as they presented their budget proposals to the state legislature. Recent highlights show tech-based economic development remains a bipartisan priority for many states: 
 
California  - Governor Gray Davis, Inaugural & State of the State Addresses, January 6 & 8, 2003 

"[W]e will make California the world's nucleus for life science innovation. This sector of the economy, perhaps more than any other, has high-growth potential, high wages for its workers, and a higher purpose - using cell technology to build healthier, happier lives. We'll build on our existing successes to put California at the center of this remarkable industry." 
 
"I will ask the Public Utilities Commission to create an Office of Economic Development. It will review all major proceedings before the PUC to determine their benefit to the economy, infrastructure and job creation. 
 
"Every large economy needs a vibrant manufacturing base. So I will ask you to extend the Manufacturers' Investment Credit. This credit is widely recognized as creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs... 
 
"To keep California on the cutting-edge of this life-saving field [life sciences], we need to launch a new Life Sciences Initiative. My Administration will focus on three things: one, increasing the number of qualified lab technicians. Two, working with the University of California to simplify the transfer of technology. Three, increasing access to venture capital and federal grants." 
 
Maine - Governor John Baldacci, Inaugural Address, January 8, 2003 

"[W]e cannot let the temporary budget troubles divert our attention from the bigger challenge of strengthening Maine's economy. In the coming weeks, I will be putting forth a detailed economic strategy. It will include "Pine Tree" opportunity zones to spur economic development in areas of Maine that really need it; a doubling of our investment in research and development to support emerging industries like biomedical research at Jackson Lab; one-stop shopping for business and trade information; and a more consolidated, consistent emphasis on regional and international opportunities with the other New England states and the maritime provinces of Canada... 
 
"One of the ways we will address [Maine's lag nationally in postsecondary performance] is by transforming the state's technical colleges into a true Community College System offering a full range of programs and making the best use of all our existing resources, including the University campuses and K-12 schools. To enhance higher education opportunities in Maine, our public higher education systems need to work collaboratively and efficiently. I have discussed this with the Chancellor of the University System and the President of the Technical College System, both of whom share this belief." 
 
New York - Governor George Pataki, State of the State Address, January 8, 2003 

"And while we deal with the immediate [fiscal] crisis we must also look beyond today and focus our sights and our energies towards the bright future that awaits us tomorrow. For we know that if we act responsibly, the crisis before us will be temporary, and if we build on the remarkable progress we've already made, the promise of the future we seek will be unlimited. 
 
"...we must pay special attention to the needs of the new high-tech economy. Two years ago, I set forth a simple but powerful idea: Combine the power of our high-tech industry with the strengths of our top-flight academic institutions – add active State government support – and we can create a new economy and a new prosperity for New York. This notion is embodied in our Centers of Excellence – a network of high-tech research and economic development centers stretching from Buffalo to Brookhaven – creating an Empire State High Tech Corridor that teams our universities with industry. 
 
"... But we need to continue our momentum by expanding our Empire State High Tech Corridor. Therefore, we are moving forward with additional Centers of Excellence – in Westchester with leading research institutions like New York Presbyterian Hospital, Cornell and Columbia universities, New York Medical College, and companies like IBM and GE, focused on biotech... And in New York City, with Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Columbia, NYU and other medical research institutions, to build on the biotech industry and academic strengths there. 
 
"We must build on the other high-tech and biotech investments we have made – in our STAR Centers, our Advanced Research Centers and our Centers for Advanced Technology – in places like Alfred, Binghamton, Potsdam and Ithaca, and throughout our Empire State High Tech Corridor. Industry and university collaboration are essential to our goal of creating a new economy in New York. 
 
"This is a critical time in our State's history. All these new projects and initiatives hold promise and they are loaded with incredible potential. They need to be nurtured with the same energy that was used to conceive and attract them." 
 
New Mexico - Governor Bill Richardson, Inaugural Address, January 1, 2003 

"The voters of New Mexico showed on Election Day that...they want a state government that supports sustainable business growth and technology development. They want New Mexico's state government to work with private business to create good, high wage jobs while protecting our state's precious natural resources..." 
 
"We will take advantage of our potentially enormous economic resources. We will reinvigorate our state universities, our national laboratories and work with the business community. We will actively promote the transfer of technology from the cutting-edge research of our labs to the private sector. We can nurture this growth to build a high-wage economy... 
 
"We must bring our unique technological and scientific resources to the cutting-edge of the newest, environmentally friendly technologies. My administration will provide incentives for energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources. We will make New Mexico an exporter of the cleaner technologies of the future." 
 
In related news, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported Wednesday that Governor Richardson announced he will ask the legislature to approve "spending about $24 million on economic-development initiatives, including $15 million for an existing in-plant training program and a one-time $9 million endowment of professorships at the state's research universities: The University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University and New Mexico Tech." 
 
North Dakota - Governor John Hoeven, State of the State Address, January 7, 2003 

"I am asking you to make a major investment in North Dakota's future – an investment of more than $100 million – an investment in an initiative we call Smart Growth. It includes new funding for both traditional economic development programs, and a new approach - marshaling all of our resources in new ways to build our future...Smart Growth is a comprehensive plan that combines education, career development, and technology with entrepreneurial business activity to create a more dynamic economy for North Dakota. 
 
"The programs in the Growing North Dakota Initiative totaled $21 million. It was a major commitment to build our future. But today, I am asking you to commit five times that investment – more than $100 million – to Smart Growth, a unified vision of teamwork and initiatives that will 'Build Our Future in North Dakota.'" 
 
"Let me give you some examples of the kinds of investments and commitments I am asking you to make in Smart Growth: 
 
- Increase teacher compensation. We must keep our best and brightest teachers here, to keep our students the best and brightest. 

- Better link our teachers to career development, to keep more of our young people in North Dakota. 

- Fully implement the Higher Education Roundtable strategy, including resources for Centers of Excellence, designed to maximize the synergy between education and entrepreneurial activity. 

- Develop ConnectND, a cutting edge information management system for the entire state - to provide schools and businesses with the tools they need to compete nationally.  

- Launch new venture capital funds - to jumpstart business activity.  

- Implement business internship programs - to help students launch careers in North Dakota. 
 
- Enhance career counseling and job placement - to make sure students find the right career and find the best opportunities in North Dakota.  Decouple state corporate income tax - to send a clear message to the world that North Dakota has a competitive tax structure, and that we are ready to do business. 

- Partner with the New Economy Initiative - to keep this vision before us at all times. 

- Offer a low-interest home buying program to attract and retain skilled workers in areas of shortages. 

- And create tax incentives to stimulate energy development and value-added agriculture, such as new initiatives for ethanol, and enhanced development of oil and gas. 

Virginia - Governor Mark Warner, State of the Commonwealth Address, January 8, 2003 

"...we currently have twenty-two workforce development programs spread across ten different agencies, in three secretariats. Too often, the current system doesn't help working Virginians when they need it most. That's why I have offered a comprehensive plan to move Virginia toward a coordinated statewide workforce development system. This plan improves the existing one-stop Workforce Development Centers. And we will FINALLY appoint a single, high-level state official to coordinate workforce development. 

"And to target young adults without high school diplomas, we have proposed creating a "middle college" within the community college system. In the information age, when job skills are more important than ever, state government should help people gain new skills - not stand in their way. 
 
"Looking beyond the session, we'll keep working to grow the economy by focusing on emerging industries and strengthening our traditional industries. 
 
"In particular, advances in the life sciences offer tremendous economic opportunities, and I intend to build on the work that our biotechnology task force began this past year." 
 
West Virginia - Governor Bob Wise, State of the State Address, January 8, 2003 

"I have also requested that we merge the Governor’s Office of Technology with the Office of Information Services and Communications. We spend millions on technology--and it’s simply not coordinated as well as it should be." 
 
U.S. Industrial R&D Expenditures Peak in 2000, NSF Reports (Source: SSTI)

U.S. companies had $199.5 billion in R&D investment in 2000, a 9 percent increase over the 1999 total, according to the annual Survey of Industrial Research and Development published by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The survey data is presented in a recent NSF InfoBrief, which shows the total industrial R&D increase to be 7 percent after adjusting for inflation.  Company funding of R&D rose from $160.2 billion in 1999 to $180.4 billion in 2000 – a 13 percent increase – and continued its steady climb since 1953, the report notes. Meanwhile, federal funding of industrial R&D contributed to the overall increase despite falling from $22.5 billion in 1999 to $19.1 billion in 2000, a 15 percent decrease. After adjusting for inflation, company-funded R&D experienced a 10 percent increase, and federal investment dropped 17 percent. 
 
Manufacturing accounted for the majority of company-funded industrial R&D in 2000, NSF reports. Sixty-one percent, or $110.8 billion, may be attributed to manufacturing industries, while 39 percent was accounted for by companies in nonmanufacturing industries, or $69.7 billion.  The full InfoBrief, NSF 03-306, is available at:  <http://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf03306> http://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf03306.

Gov. Bush --

I noticed mentions in some of the national coverage of the affirmative
action story this morning that your brief takes a more direct line than the
White House's. That is, you argue that racial diversity does not necessarily
pass the "compelling interest" test. It's also interesting in your brief
that your lawyers argue for a "better way," touting One Florida with
language that is not at all legalistic but almost more political or
ideological.

Being an average civilian, I didn't realize this yesterday when I asked you
about your brief. So I ask now: Was it your intention to take a harder line
than the WH, and did you actually slip in the section about the "better
way?"

I'm asking because I am writing my Sunday column about this.

Best,

Subject:	Addendum Brevard Zoning Revisions re:  FS 419.001(2)

FYI -- 

We recorded the actual remarks made by Ron Prichard, Board of County Commissioners of Brevard on 01/14/03, concerning the revision of group home ordinance to allow for more leniency in regard to F.S. 419.001, the 1,000 ft. rule: 


"We have mainstreamed developmentally disabled children and adults into the school system for years and we are mainstreaming the same into the community.  It's been slow in coming.  It's a necessary step.  It should have happened years ago.  We can't take that back.  Let's make it happen today.  I move that we accept the proposed amendment to Chapter 62." 


In my e-mail of Jan. 15, 2003, I wrote: 


We are pleased to let you know that the Board of County Commissioners accepted our proposals 
for amending the group home ordinance. The language of "Reasonable Accommodation" will allow 
relief from the restrictions of FS 419.001(2) -- the thousand foot rule. 


Briefly, our proposals included: 


1.  Specific citations from the Fair Housing Act 


2.  Specific reference to factors, such as potential benefits that can be accomplished by reasonable 
accommodation: 


          Opportunity to enjoy support, security, location, services, proximity to work or friends 
               provided  in a group home in the community of choice 
         Opportunity to plan a residential community with special amenities 
         Choice of alternative accommodations 


A statement made by one of the Commissioners in favor of the revision said that they have been 
working for years to achieve inclusion in the schools; now they needed to achieve inclusion in the 
community! 


We think you will agree that this is a step forward. 


Our special thanks to Myriam and Bent Brix, Eugenie Amalfitano, Barbara Haynes and Nancy 
Baker for their support at this hearing.

We also know the only way that will happen is if we become strong enough in numbers to be an influence, at the polls.  We must hold off on all individual efforts long enough to support the February 12, 2003 rally in DC.  The outcome may very well dictate how our National Security and our future way of life is determined.

Florida Guides Association 
Column 
16 January 2003 
Capt. Dave Markett 
Sr. Vice President 



Florida Guides Association wants to take this opportunity to point out more
positive change in the winds blowing through Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission (FWC). In an earlier column we noted one of the
first acts under the leadership of newly appointed director Dr. Ken Haddad
was to convene a meeting of fish and wildlife interest groups to develop
long range strategic planning goals for the FWC as a whole. This represents
a dramatic shift in FWC attitude and direction from past leadership
positions. 

Comes now to FGA, notice of and an invitation to participate in, another
strategic planning session from FWC. In Tallahassee, on Wednesday, February
5, Col. Julie Jones, newly appointed head of FWC Division of Law
Enforcement, is convening a blue-ribbon panel of 60 key FWC "Stakeholders"
to participate in setting future goals and direction for FWC / DLE. When was
the last time any state law enforcement group asked you for guidance and
direction as to what you felt the greatest needs for law enforcement
improvement were? FGA looks forward to active participation in this activity
and we intend to point out some areas that we feel need attention. 

One of the areas where FGA believes improvements are possible is a program
of cooperation between FWC / DLE and the angler / guide community. Several
years ago, there was such a program developed by the old Florida Marine
Patrol and Florida Conservation Association called "Coast Watch" wherein
areas of habitual violations were more closely monitored. 

That cooperative effort resulted in significant major marine resource
violations being identified and successfully prosecuted. FGA is not
suggesting that our members or recreational anglers take on the role of "Big
Brother", but we feel that large scale or repeated marine resource
violations destroy the effectiveness of current fishing rules and most often
lead to even more restrictive regulations. Something none of us wants to see
happen. 

FWC / DLE is also asking for input from interested members of the general
public as well. They have set up an online survey to better determine
individual opinions about the future direction of the Division of Law
Enforcement. Take a moment, if you will, and reply to: 

www.group-solutions.com/ss/wsb.dll/vern/flfd.htm/fwcbrc.htm 

This is a unique opportunity for all / each of us to make our own
suggestions for improvements to the FWC / Division of Law Enforcement.  They
have asked for our help and direction. If we fail to participate, then we
are partly to blame if future efforts fall short of the target.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am a University professor of School Psychology. As an academician, I know 
there is irrefutable proof that effective prevention programs are the key 
to preventing a myriad of long term problems in our youth, including drug 
abuse, school dropout, juvenile delinquency, and teen pregnancy.  As a 
Board member of Capital City Youth Services here in Tallahassee, I have 
seen first hand the benefits to children and families of this type of 
prevention.  The recent Tax Watch study has documented the tremendous cost 
savings to the citizens of Florida of runaway programs.  I encourage you to 
support funding for CINS/FINS and runaway programs in Florida. Thank you.

Subject:	Stronger Families will Lead to a Stronger Florida

Governor Bush,
Thank you for inviting comments and stories in your editorial in the Democrat last week.  The story I have to tell is not a happy one.  I learned of a 14 year old boy from Taylor County that went to detention and will likey now go to a residential commitment program.  After months of family violence, where this boy witnessed his mother being beaten by his father, the Sheriff's Office responded to aid in one of the incidents.  The father became violent with the deputy, who had to restrain him on the ground and place him in handcuffs.  While the deputy was struggling with the father, the son was watching and distraught and ran up to the deputy and kicked him in the back begging him to "get off his Daddy."  Of course the boy was charged with assaulting an officer, a serious offense.

 I learned of his story from his Juvenile Probation Officer.  This man stated that a year ago when there was a CINS/FINS counselor there in his office, he could have directly referred this family and many other like them, before the child became violent - when "prevention" was truly possible.  He said that when he did have that resource in the past, he never "heard from those families again, but now they are all on his Probation caseload."

The majority of CINS/FINS counselors were cut last year - and now the cut in prevention is showing up in detention centers, commitment programs, kids being removed from their homes and kids on the street.

Please do what you can to support these needed services.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
If you are in the DC area on 12 Feb. 2003, beginning at 10:00 AM, please show your support for our Military Retirees by standing with them (information below my sig. block).  You certainly supported them when you signed the "Florida's Health Care Resolution for Military Retirees" on 18 May 1999.  I realize the resolution is outdated now, but if you believed so strongly in it in 1999 I trust you must feel the same today.

A formal unveiling will occur on 22 January 2003, 1 PM at 6100 East Capitol St, Capitol Heights, MD of physical and moving "Billboards" reflecting a message that challenges the US Governments denial of promised medical care to WWII/Korea era military retirees.

The message will be visible on major thoroughfares in the National Capitol Region on three separate billboards and in support of a Feb 12, 2003 Washington DC Rally.

All billboards will be protesting the November 2002 decision by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Schism vs. United States, which held that the government did not have to honor military recruiters’ promises of government funded "lifetime health care."

Medal of Honor recipient, former POW in Hanoi, Colonel George "Bud" Day, attorney, representing Plaintiff’s Robert Reinlie, William Schism and thousands of other military retirees of the Class Act Group will petition the US Supreme Court to hear and reverse the recent Federal Circuit Court of Appeals decision.

Organizer’s of the Class Act Group expect hundreds of WWII/Korean War military retirees, spouses and supporters from throughout the nation at the Feb 12, 2003 rally in Washington D.C. in support of Colonel Day, himself a former U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and prisoner-of-war during the Vietnam War. The billboards are designed to emphasize the "Broken Promises" of the U.S. Government, which for decades guaranteed all retired military personnel, lifetime medical care.

Large lettering on all three billboards accompanied by a caricature depicting military retirees of all branches of service, will prominently state that "WW II/Korean Vets Fight to Recover Stolen Medical Care." (Billboard picture included in this press release)

Billboards will be situated at key locations on three major thoroughfares in the northeast region of the capital. One billboard will be on US 1, one mile north of Beltsville, MD, south of Route 50, facing north and four miles from the University of Maryland. The second billboard will be located on Kenilworth Ave., also south of Route 50, facing north. The third billboard will be located at 6100 East Capitol St, Capitol Heights, MD, approximately three miles west of I-495 (Beltway), Exit #15B

Governor Bush,
When I heard that you gave an open invitation to hear stories and comments from the community many things ran through my mind. I have been working with children for the last 12 years of my life. In those twelve years I have seen children that are often considered "success stories", the ones that after receiving prevention services were able to maintain healthy somewhat normal lives. These are the children that come back and visit our agency and lend their hearts and hands to help another. 

Then there are the stories that cause you to go home and hug your own children a little tighter. The stories that frighten us and make us wonder why, are often linked to a break in "the chain". A chain that, in the past, consisted of CINS/FINS services that aided children and their families in their quest for peace in troubled times.

A great number of CINS/FINS counselors were cut last year and the cut is moving through the chain of service. The end result will be more sad stories and troubled times.

My plea is for you to support these services for they will ultimately support the future of our children.

Subject:	Adoption Process Improvement?

Governor, would you consider appointing a panel to look at ways to improve the adoption process?  I know a lot of people who want to adopt a child, and have the financial means to handle the additional expense, but not the $10,000 adoption fees.  If they have to take out a loan to cover those expenses, they no longer have the additional monies for child expenses.  Maybe you could allocate a portion of the DCF budget to reducing their  number of children being in foster care by increasing the number adopted each year. Thanks for listening…

     I would like to invite you to a special event taking place in Orlando, Florida January 31 and February 1, 2003.  It is an elite group of Dentist from all over the United States and Canada.  These dentist are in the top 10% and have formed an alliance to give back to the communities.  They sponsor childrens charities all over the United States and Canada, making the world a better place.  They meet once a year in really nice places and have selected Orlando this year.  I live in Melbourne, Florida and have been associated with Crown Council now for 7 years.  It would make such a difference if there were some way you could stop by during the time they are having their meeting in Orlando.  It would just be the icing on the cake.  I do not know any one in high places so I am taking my chances just to e-mail you and just ASK.  I would appreciate you considering this invitation and let me know if there would be a chance.  You can e-mail me at Joan@Wickline.net.  Thank you for you time in this matter.

Subject: Bureaucrats to teachers

Jeb,
I had a thought today on the way to work.  I was thinking about your speech
the other day saying that you wanted to empty out the halls of government.
Here is an idea.  Since we already have a troops to teachers program, why
not have a bureaucrats to teachers program.   What better person to teach
health sciences in high school than a former employee of DOH,   what better
person to teach economics than a former state economist.  The program could
be set up as  a way to downsize government without the layoffs.   Since the
state is spending nearly 5000 or more to recruit teachers, why not give a
bureaucrat who pledges to teach for 5 years, 3 months of their current
governmental salary as a bonus.  The cost savings would be recognized in
the overall decrease in FTE's and salary.  For example, a state employee
making $40,000 would get a check for $10,000.   The state would end up
saving the remaining $30,000 of their salary, plus the $5,000 that the
state already uses to recruit teachers, the state downsizes without
layoffs, and finally the state gets a 5 year guarantee for a teacher.
Take Care.

Barrett

Dear Gov. Jeb,
    Hopefully, we can keep Frank Brogan as your Lt. Gov--he is outstanding.  
    But if he goes to FAU, you will need to appoint a new person.
    This email is to recommend JENNIFER CARROLL for the job.  She would be outstanding.  Some reasons why this is a good idea are:
    1.  Jennifer has the character and the ability to do an excellent job; she would represent you and our state well.
    2.  She would be the first woman Lt. Gov. in Florida.
    3.  She would be the first African- American Lt. Gov. in the U.S. (I think).
    4.  Her appointment would take some of the sting out of all of the negative Affirmative Action publicity.
    5.  Her appointment would help to prove to African-Americans that you are sincere, and our party is sincere, when we say we are the party of inclusion.
   I hope and pray that you will appoint her.  May God continue to bless you.  Remember that the republicans of Alachua County  are still solidly behind you.  Pete Enwall

Re:SB 178
 
To recipients of this forward, please understand the negative impact this legislation would have on many different people in our society. The sheer impossibility in execution of the 500 foot rule in most communities should be enough to persuade its readers against it, but the bigger message pertains to the total lack of respect it shows towards those we should be embracing.

Subject: 500 feet?

It would appear that you would like as little contact with people who are disabled, frail, old, abandoned - the weaker in our society - by virtue of the legislation that you are proposing. This is clearly discrimination, from a legal standpoint. But from a human standpoint, it certainly does not jibe with any teachings of God, or of humanity. I am not sure what your reasoning is, but you may want to rethink what it is you are trying to accomplish.
 
Most communities today that are affordable for most people (disabled or otherwise) contain houses that are less than 50 feet away from each other. Where is this land you speak of? Do you propose that those who are banished by the 500 foot rule can afford the cost of the land that you require they put between themselves and the rest of the neighborhood? Are you being that blatant in shutting so many in our society out? In most cultures, the stronger care for the weak. It is legislation such as yours that gives America a bad name, and takes us away from true family values. Have you considered how you would feel if a loved one in your family was restricted in such a way that precluded them from living in society?

I am a parent and social worker in Pensacola.  I adopted two children: biological sisters and  victims of abuse and neglect before the age of 2. The children have lived with me since 1994 and are now 13 and 14.  I have just heard that CINS/FINS services will be cut.  Before you choose to cut these service, please understand that the families served may not have access to any other services: in Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties finding family counseling is difficult, even when the family has insurance.  The CINS/FINS services help keep families intact.  They offer options and hope to children and parents.  They allow for case management for families, through services in the home and community.  Please strongly consider the continuation of these services.  My family has personally found benefit from these services, and I have referred other families in need to them over the past 10 years.

there when I want her to see me ...on the street of the capitol talking to the Governor .. 
She thinks I make it all up....her way of keeping me humble I guess. 

 ----- 

On the reading certification program... 
I talked to Mary Laura this morning. My colleague Rick Wilson is on the 
Polk Education Foundation which is principally business interests focused on 
local education. Rick is going to try to challenge member businesses of  The Polk Education 
Foundation to match us...so if we get 20 people in the program, they match with 20 of their's 
in the program....If we can do 25 then the total would be 50 overall in the program. 
Rick's idea...I thought it was pretty good....so we're off.

And finally, at least someone can get the Ledger to print an opposing view on Tort Reform... 

from today's Lakeland Ledger: 

Published Friday, January 17, 2003 
Demand Tort Reform 

What a breath of fresh air to read a response to David B. Higginbottom's letter to the editor, by another lawyer. Thank you, Stuart D. Willson. Mr. Willson was apparently practicing law back when lawyers were interested in the good of the country, rather than lining their own pockets.

Our worker-compensation insurance is nearly twice that of neighboring Georgia and Alabama because the lion's share of our premiums go to lawyers. Our doctors are leaving, and nursing homes and hospitals are going broke, even with their ridiculously high fees.

While lawyers file more lawsuits, insurance goes up. When insurance goes up, hospitals and nursing homes must cut back on staff, nurses and doctors to survive. This, in turn, diminishes service and care, which invites more lawsuits. It's a never-ending cycle, which keeps getting worse.

People don't seem to get alarmed when they see these huge settlements. Do they not realize each and every one of us pay for this indirectly? Several folks, who had never voted any way but Democratic, voted for Jeb Bush because they didn't want lawyer Bill McBride as governor and escalating the situation even more. We need to get behind our governor and demand tort reform.

Certainly, all lawyers are not bad, but Mr. Higginbottom and his trial-lawyer friends are going to "help" us poor downtrodden citizens until we no longer have a doctor or hospital to go to. As one pundit put it, the trial lawyers are not satisfied to just shear the sheep -- they want to gut them too.

Dear Governor Bush,

Lt. Fran Clark of the Polk County Sheriff's Office is getting ready to
retire on Jan. 30 after 25 exemplary years of service to the citizens of
Polk County and it would make her day to receive a congratulatory card or
letter from you as she is one of your staunchest supporters. In fact Sir you
have met her and she has a picture of the two of you.

She was one of the first female sworn deputies in the department (and a
single mom to boot) and was until very recently it's highest ranking female
deputy. During her long and distinguished career she has received numerous
awards and worked in nearly every division of the sheriff's office through
many administrations, good and bad. She is well known & respected throughout
the Lakeland area and is an active member of the community.

Her home address is:

452 Market Square East
Lakeland, FL  33813
Ph: 863-644-6713

This would really be a thrill for her Sir. Thank you VERY much in advance.
May God Bless you, our great President and your entire wonderful family.
Keep up the great work and congrats in trouncing "what's his name" in the
election.

Please allow the appropriate arm of the law to do its job. We the people, 
need leadership in these type of situations with enough foresight to 
minimize the potential for our state reaping from seeds of this nature sown 
throughout and producing an exponential crop of unrest, division and an

On Nov. 5th I went against the recommendation of my peers and voted my

Your fate lies in your hands; Place her fate back in her hands.

Dear Gov. Jeb,
 
       This email is to recommend JENNIFER CARROLL for the job of Lt. Gov. if

good idea are:
1.  Jennifer has the character and the ability to do an excellent job; she 
would represent you and your state well.
2.  She would be the first woman Lt. Gov. in Florida.
3.  She would be the first African-American Lt. Gov. in the U.S. (I think).
4.  Her appointment would take some of the sting out of the negative 
Affirmative Action publicity.
5.  Her appointment would help to prove to African-Americans that you are 
sincere, and our party is sincere, when we say we are the party of inclusion.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:
 
I write you at this time to obtain some guidance on the issue of  legal trade with Cuba.  Currently, the Port of  Tampa's policy is not to solicit approved authorized trade with Cuba.  As you may be aware, there is increasing local pressure on the Port for not actively seeking permitted shipments to Cuba.  Several Florida agricultural interests have by-passed the Port for shipments to Cuba, and most recently one of our tenants arranged a shipment out of the Port of Manatee.  Understanding the political nature of this issue, I believe we should not prevent or be an obstacle to Florida agricultural interests in trading with Cuba that is allowed under current U.S. policy.  To maintain the current policy of the Port will only serve to inhibit the growth and development of the Port.
 
Please be apprised this afternoon John Thorington and I will be attending a public luncheon sponsored by La Gaceta, in attendance will be a Cuban official, whose name I do not know at this time.  
 
I would appreciate your advice on these matters.  I await your reply.  Thank you.

Like many communities in Florida, we're facing significant challenges to our growth as businesses. Yet we recognize the importance of investing in human capital and in the creation of an education and workforce infrastructure. It is commonly understood that most businesses and companies on the run informally voice their experience, concerns, and availability needs and direction on workforce issues relevant to their industry. That is why we have created this environment for you.

NOW IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO COME TO THE TABLE!

* Do you have an adequate, qualified work force?
* Do you know where to go for training your personnel?
* Do you have input for your industry's direction in workforce development?
* How flexible is the workforce "system" for your changing business needs?
* Are there career paths, ladders, for your personnel to follow?
* Do you need new ways of training and educating?
* Are we adequately prepared to support our business' plans?
* How do we assure soft skills training for all our employees?

The majority of BROWARDworks!' participants should be employers, with appropriate representation from education and training providers, as well as other workforce development-concerned individuals. BROWARDworks! seeks an employer focus, in an industry-specific orientation,  meeting employer needs and putting into place employer-driven solutions to our workforce supply mechanisms.

Dear Gov.

	For whatever it is worth coming from a Jeb-Democrat who has
absolutely no
stake in the Supervisor issue, Janet Kovach would make a stellar
Supervisor
of Elections.  She is competent, smart, fair and even-handed.  She
actually
wants the job to do the job, not because she needs one or is looking at
it
as a stepping stone (although she is so good, so could climb higher if
she
so chose to do so).  Furthermore, I believe your apppointment would be
perceived as merit based by the larger community.  Given the debacles we
have had in certain areas of the state, I would think this is important.

Good luck in the upcoming session.  And from an ardent rail guy, you are
right on high speed rail to the extent your position has been accurately
portrayed in the press.  If the private sector won't assume 100% of
operating risk, the deal shouldn't happen.

Subject: Court Strikes Predator Statute
Importance: High


In the last couple of days, I've been reading some very distressing news in relationship to our position on Sexual Predator laws and registration and house arrest, and wanted to bring up some of my concerns.
 
First of all, Jeb, YOU of all people know what I had to go through to get that on the books in the first place.  And from my sources, I understand it was in miracle time too - only 2 years to accomplish something that ordinarily takes 4-6.  And don't get me wrong, I certainly understand "case law".  Law can NEVER BE so black and white that there are NO exceptions.
 
However, in the above referenced titled story of the Court striking the Predator act in the Miami-Dade area, it states, that "what we're asking for...is a hearing for a judge to determine whether a person is really dangerous".
 
So since that story is on the heels of another regarding house arrest I meant to talk to you about anyway, let me illustrate why this is a bad idea...
 
In a former case of "house arrest" where I first got involved in starting my own organization there was this story.
 
A Lake County Deputy was arrested for admittedly raping his 13-year old deaf step-daughter.  When I investigated this case further, I found out the reason house arrest was given, was because the guy had a very good lawyer, and typically child molesters and LEO's don't fare well in jail...but, that there were 6 other children in the home.  Training with law enforcement as I have done, there are different typologies of pedophiles, but this type certainly wouldn't be a good one to give house arrest to under these circumstances.  When I wrote the judge saying, basically, "What were you thinking" because no one will check in the middle of the night to see if he is violating anyone or not and that IS NOT SUPERVISION.  When I then brought in the cameras and media for his "next decision" on the case, he went to this..."Okay, he'll wear an anklet device that will work in reverse".  He will be required to leave the house when his wife goes to work and cannot return until she comes home.  So I asked the Probation people (very helpful btw), "What's to stop him from picking up a 6 pack of beer at a convenience store and hanging out in playgrounds all day?" Their reply..."Nothing. He certainly could do that and we wouldn't know."
 
Our judges are not properly trained in these affairs to know if someone is a danger or not. In fact, where there are one set of "expert witnesses" for the defense, they are an equal amount for the prosecution and usually prosecution cannot afford the same type of "expert" witnesses that a high expensive defense attorney can to even BEGIN to educate judges adequately...look at the OJ Simpson case for an example of that.
 
Modifications should be made to all things that stray from the unusual as necessary, but let's not throw out the baby with the bath water PLEASE.

Subject: beach dredge and fill


Dear Governor Bush,
       It has come to my attention you are meeting with your aides again
on 
the 22nd and would again like to express my feelings on dredging. I have
done 
several projects on dredging and have encouraged my peers to research it
and 
give me their opinion on dredging and they thought it was horrible
because it 
destroys our hardbottom reefs and kills our fish. Please note that
myself and 
others do not like this project and think you shouldn't allow them to
dredge 
but to maybe build a boardwalk over the water or a pier.
                                           Sincerely,
                                      Ethan Addicott

I currently serve as the President of The Arc of Palm Beach County,

since 1958, and we are now facing a crisis that threatens the viability
of our vital operations.  We desperately need your help!

Insurers are refusing to write worker's comp. policies for nonprofits

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
My name is Jessica Jones, and I'm a journalism major at the University of West Florida.  I  want to let you know that I am pleased with your support of President Bush on the decision to put an end to affirmative action.  
 
 I completely agree with your statements;  rather than eliminating discrimination, affirmative action has simply reversed the roles.  
 
Hearing about the students who weren't accepted to a university for race reasons angered me.  I fully support your One Florida program and I look forward to learning how President Bush ill ease this affirmative action issue for the nation.
 
If there is anything I can do to help (such as writing a newspaper article about this issue for our school paper), please let me know.
 
Thanks again,

Sir, my future step daughter was diagnosed with bipolar disease about 
two years ago.  My fiance and I have spent a great deal of money on 
private psychiatrists, counselors, and medications.  The private 
counselor that we were using was no longer able to help this girl. 
Luckily, we found Hillsborough County Family and Child Counseling and 
they have been an incredible help.  The counselor that she is seeing now 
through the county is a very patient and professional gentlemen and we 
all feel that Kelsey is getting some very valuable assistance.

We feel strongly that closing these offices would be an injustice to the 
residence who utilize (and depend) on the county counseling center for 
support.  If you and your family depended on these type of government 
services, you might feel differently about eliminating their funds and 
their offices.

Hi Jeb, 
Families Against Drugs is putting on a golf tournament fundraiser on May 30 at Alaqua Country Club and would like you to  play in it. I have only enough money left to get us through 'til March and then I am out of business.  I will get sponsors to give me the money up front so we can make it, financially, until the golf tournament.  Sept. 11 hit all non-profits hard because all the money went to NY and I always lose out on grant money to the Big Dogs.  If you were to play in the tournament, people would be begging to play for us.  I have been honored to have received so many wonderful awards for what I do but, quite frankly, I cannot pay the bills of running a non-profit with certificates and medals. Please say you will play in the tournament....you are a perfect  match with FAD at this time because of Noelle's problems. I have attached the flyer so you can see the details.
Thanks,
Tinker

Governor,

It was good to see you yesterday.  Your continued interest in our new
Center for Energy and Technology of the Americas (CETA) at Florida
International University will make the difference in doing something big
for FIU and for Florida.

We just learned that Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham (202-586-6210)
now wants to publicly announce this new center on Friday, February 14 at
FIU.  He is particularly interested in your being part of the
announcement.

If at all possible, we would be honored and appreciative if you could
join the Secretary and me on February 14 for an 11 a.m. announcement
followed--if your schedule allows—by a luncheon.

Under any future scenario, the U.S. is expected to continue to increase
it's reliance on imported oil, largely from the Persian Gulf.  CETA will
serve as an energy technology and policy development vehicle to the U.S.
Department of Energy and industry to promote U.S. energy security and
increase cooperation on energy issues among Western Hemisphere
countries.  We believe that CETA's mission to enhance the development of
conventional and renewable energy supplies and to improve energy
efficiency throughout Latin American and the Caribbean is critical in
these challenging times to our nation's energy security.

A win-win proposition for both the U.S. and Latin America,  Secretary
Abraham has already committed $3 million (we had asked for $5M to
start.)  We anticipate that with your support this center can grow
substantially into a major federal research laboratory in South Florida.

Please let me know if it's possible for you to be with us on the 14th.

Subject: Florida Springs Protection


Dear Governor Bush:

I am saddened to see Florida's water slowly being given up for sale to the benefit of outside entities. I was notified of the upcoming Springs Task Force Conference via email recently, and, upon reading it, noticed that two major sponsors are spring water bottlers, one of which has done well documented damages to national springs, not to mention having trampled upon the rights of local citizens (Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas, and Florida for starters). 

The company I am referring to: Nestle, or as they call themselves now, Great Nestle Waters of America (AKA Perrier). This corporation has closed local springs long held dear to children and adults, as well as forced their way into areas of Florida and the USA against major public outcry by way of lawsuits, harassment, and promises of big dollars to those that would help them get a foot in the door.

Governor Bush, does not Florida's water, as one of your aides quoted to me two years ago, "...belong to no one individual, but to everyone"? And, if this company is to take our water, why are they not required to pay royalties to the State, as well as be closely monitored in their daily activities? My organization Save Our Springs has proven time and again that this company is dishonest and we have reported them at one spring on several occasions for having over pumped their daily allotment (and other atrocities); even during the height of the drought. 

SWFWMD is weak when it comes to handling this company, and ,is now, to appease their immense thirst, allowing them to truck in (a waste of energy) water from another source miles away, to dump into the river what the spring naturally would have been doing. All this so they could get a several hundred thousand gallon per day increase on their permit at Crystal Springs, which locals had prevented from happening for several years. Now they have it anyway. This is certainly one of the most preposterous, if not just laughable examples of government gone bad I have ever seen.

How can we, when knowing that conflict will develop over water in the future, allow a FOREIGN corporation so much control over local resources like fresh water? Doesn't the majority of the people of Florida have a say in this, and not those that would sell the very water out from under their feet? Bottled spring water is not a necessity for life, and certainly costs more per gallon than gasoline. Why are these companies only paying business taxes and such, and not paying the people of Florida for the immense wealth they are making from our aquifer? Couldn't they pay royalties and be required to finance water restoration and environmental programs for the water they take for free and sell right back to us?

Yes, I understand the argument that some of these companies are willing to buy up springshed land to "protect it". But, wouldn't it be more desirable to have American land be owned by Americans, at least when it comes to access to a precious natural resource like fresh water? When the earth is groaning with a burdensome future population, who will ultimately control our water? The good people of the state of Florida, or, a foreign corporation which is only concerned with it's own capital gain? 

The rate of growth in my home state is already frightening, as well as the prospects of how overburdened natural resources will be able to support in the next twenty years.  I would think it wise that we as floridians consider guarding our resources carefully, as well as preserve as much natural land as possible. This should be the top priority over growth and new rooftops.

Yes, "good, clean" industry sounds good on paper and when spoken,  but at what cost is this industry of spring water bottling  operating in our state. I would humbly suggest you read the news around the country right now, Governor Bush. You might be surprised at how big this issue really is becoming. In fact the January 13 the issue of PEOPLE magazine features our President Terri Wolfe, and a lot of attention is given to Florida and springwater bottlers.

Please, Mr. Governor, consider what our DEP is condoning in the name of "preservation". Look into the damaging effects of borehole wells on our limestone aquifers. Finally, please realize that this company, Perrier, is NOT the good neighbor they claim to be, with their slick PR persons and "scientific surveys". They are shrewd business people with only one agenda. This agenda does not take our best interests into consideration.

Thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration.

Sincerely,

Brad Willis
Vice President,  Save our Springs, Inc.

Dear Governor Bush,

I spoke with you tonight at your reception about the Broadband Wireless
service we are launching this month in Jacksonville.  It is the largest
US
commercial deployment of a new wireless broadband technology.  Since you
are
known as an avid supporter of technology growth in Florida, we would
like to
invite you to deliver the keynote remarks at our Feb 12th ribbon-cutting
ceremony in Jacksonville.

As I mentioned, we are a Dallas-based company funded by Goldman Sachs
and 
other private investors, including Rusty Rose, who was President Bush's
partner in the Texas Rangers, and will also attend the event as a member
of
our Board.  We have been developing this since 1998 and chose Florida
and
Jacksonville as our first service area, in part for its pro-tech
leadership.

Reasons for considering this event are:

-- Reinforces Florida, Jacksonville and your Administration as national
leaders in introducing new broadband technologies (a first in the US)
-- Introduction of Wireless Broadband complements City of Jacksonville's
10
year technology plan
-- Broadband availability provides economic incentive for business and
employment growth in Florida
-- Addresses the Digital Divide with a new technology that fills
coverage
gaps with an affordable wireless alternative
-- Provides competition to Cable and Phone Monopolies: currently up to
50%
of businesses in Jacksonville do not qualify for DSL

We would sincerely appreciate your consideration of our request and look
forward to communicating with you and your staff further.  If you are
interested in seeing our website, it can be found at www.clearwire.com.

I certainly enjoyed meeting you this evening, and appreciate your
hospitality.

Best Regards,

Governor:

Since briefing you by phone Friday afternoon on the status of the ACF litigation, 
I have learned that my call to Andy paid off.  The Dept. of Justice reversed 
course, preventing long term damage to Florida's (and the environment's) 
interests.  Wanted to make sure you knew this in case you speak with him.

I had good conversations today with Theresa Tinker, Colleen Castille, and 
Kathleen regarding the state's land acquisition program at Dept. of Community 
Affairs.  I still believe an "enterprise" approach to land acquisition makes the 
most sense and would provide better program integration and improved 
efficiency.  (A position that Colleen and Theresa both acknowledge they 
previously advocated!).  However, I ceded to their new position with the promise 
that the program at DCA be reformed so we stop carrying forward such large 
unencumbered cash balances.

I was pleased you found the response to Terry Rice regarding 8.5 useful.  
Thanks for sending it.  Note it was Denver who had the good idea to suggest to 
Terry Rice that the federal government should lead by example by moving its 
employees out of the affected area.  We will follow up with Fran Mainella to get 
that going.

Subject:	Thank You - Re:  Miriam Oliphant

Thank you for placing the decision regarding the Supervisor of Elections in Broward County where it belongs - at the local level.  As a registered voter in Broward County and a pollworker in the last two elections, I am deeply concerned about the frenzy of the media and other public officials in Broward County who refuse to indicate that only 3% of the polls opened late for the September primary election.  Additionally,when the budget was prepared no one, including the public officials who fund the Supervisor's budget or the County Budget Office that made substantial cuts in the Supervisor's proposed budget, anticipated the added expense of moving to a more sophisticated electronic voting system, and funded this expense at the appropriate level.

Although a recent audit revealed some discrepancies in spending, the Supervisor of Elections has agreed to address those issues, including taking a reduction in pay.  Additionally, it appears that a double standard is being applied in Broward County.  Some years ago, another Constitutional Officer overspent his budget by more than $600,000 at the same time that law suits were pending against his office and him personally.  There was no call from public officials in Broward County for his suspension.  Additionally, County divisions routinely overspend their budgets, some annually by more than a million dollars, without incident.

Is there a more vicious ulterior motive in wanting to replace Miriam Oliphant?  Earlier this year, the Charter Review Commission in Broward County attempted to have only the Supervisor's Office, of the three constitutional offices in Broward County, placed under the purview of the Broward County Commission and failed.  The citizens of Broward County believed that Ms. Oliphant was being targeted, not only because she is the only female elected constitutional officer, but because she is a minority.

Ms. Oliphant should be granted the opportunity to respond on January 25th to the issues outlined in your recent letter.  The continuation of allegations, innuendo, half-truths, etc. only detract from her ability to fulfill the duties for which the citizens of Broward County elected her to perform.

conflict with your budget announcement and our annual pre-session
editors meeting.  After failing to resolve it over the phone, I was
ordered to go to the Ritz-Carlton to make a personal plea to you in an
effort to resolve the conflict.  I left at the request of your staff,
but would still appreciate the opportunity to find a solution that would
benefit us both. In short, you plans to announce your budget proposal at
10:30 a.m. at the Capitol Tuesday coincides with the beginning of the AP
meeting. Because of the importance of your announcement, we may find
ourselves having to delay the meeting and/or cancel portions of it.
Please see the attached agenda.  You will quickly understand why there
would be a problem for us.

I realize the importance of your time, and we would be willing to switch
any portion of our agenda and allow you as much time as you need if you
would consider making the announcement at our meeting. About 120 editors
and reporters from around the state have made plans to attend this
year's meeting, which would give you an excellent opportunity to reach a
wider audience.

I also realize that your attendance at our meeting is an honor for us
and you have no obligation to address our group. In the event that you
do make your budget announcement at the Capitol, would you consider
moving the time up to 9 a.m. so it does not overlap with the AP
meeting?  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me
on my cell phone (850) 591-5805.

Jeb:
Yes, this is true--as long as we accept the principle that each school
system should operate a single, large, centralized transportation system.
It remains to be seen whether contracted smaller systems that operate within
a given feeder pattern might be equally efficient and more family friendly.

And, for sure we are spending "serious money" on detaining juveniles and
otherwise paying for the breakdown in family cohesion.

Making government more family friendly is not a simple proposition, I know.
Our present situation has evolved over years, and its base was the time when
most mothers were at home all day and could compensate for the chaos of the
schedules.  Now that most mothers are working at least part time, the
"efficiencies" have become very costly.

Is it possible to at least open a dialog?  If you were to convene a meeting
on the subject, I would love to participate.   TaxWatch might be able to
help, too--I know they are interested in the school transportation issue
from a cost-saving point of view.

Best,

PS  What they say about grandparenting is true--it is the reward we get for

We would be honored if you and Mrs. Bush would be able to attend as Honorary Chairman. This signature event is attended by citizens form our entire state and has become the season opener for Palm Beach.The Gala is an extremely lively party with an emphasis on Abilities not disabilities. Your and Mrs. Bush's presence would certainly keep this message in the forefront.The event raises funds for the Able Trust endowment and for the endowment funds of participating agencys from around the state of Florida. The Able Trust not only provides a vehicle for these agencys to create and fund endowments for the future of their agencys, but we also provide matching funds for this event. The gala is completely underwriten by Able Trust patrons,such as The George E. Batchelor Foundation, and therefore at zero cost to the participating agencys. It is our hope that you will be able to set aside this date on your unbelievably hectic calender to be with us. Thankyou for considering helping The Able Trust.

Subject: 8.5 Injustice: Sad for the Everglades and even more sad for democracy


Dear Governor Bush, 

      I was forwarded your message which said: 



I know this is an emotional issue and both of you feel strongly about your positions.  After reviewing all of the information, I still cannot support your conclusions about that 1992 Plan (Alternative 1) can achieve the goals of the Modified Water Deliveries Project. 



Response: 
      I do not understand how you can make this statement if you read table 6 attached to the Chairman Cypress letter to Senator Inhofe which comes from the Corps SEIS on the 8.5 Square Mile Area.  The goal of the Modified Water Deliveries Project is to restore more natural flows to Shark River Slough to the extent practicable.  The Corps own SEIS chart (not ours) shows that Alternative 1 (the 1992 Plan) and Alternative 2b (the 1992 Plan modified for CREPE) meets this goal.  What facts do you have to the contrary? The EIS also shows that 6(d) has a red light for implementation and 1 and 2(b) have green lights. That is because condemning and forcibly removing people that don't want to leave their homes will take a very long time.  In fact, the controversy will only escalate.  The homeowners are already on Cuban radio and planning a march in little Havana next week. And, a major network is working on this poignant human interest story on their plight right now. 

      You may think that capitulating to political pressure is the best thing to do to jump-start Mod Waters and Everglades restoration.  I am telling you that it will only lead to MORE DELAY of a project that could be finished and restoring flows in six months to a year if the levee went up.  A project that would be restoring 900,000 acres of wetlands today if a bold leader would stand up and do the right thing.  I actually thought that leader would be you. 

      To me this is both a moral issue and an Everglades issue.  The EIS also says the Miccosukee Tribal Everglades loses eight tree islands a year because of the delay of Mod Waters.  These jewels of the Everglades, which are vital to the history and way of life of an Indian Tribe, are being lost forever.  It sounds to me that you believe that since the environmentalists held up Mod Waters for years trying to remove the entire community and could not, that you should now  support a plan that sacrifices 77 families for them even if it's not necessary for restoration. I simply do not understand this reasoning.  To me, it is reminiscent of throwing people to the lions to please the crowd. 

      I found it ironic the article about alleged property rights advocate Gail Norton's announcement that she favored condemning families in the 8.5 was right next to reservists being called to Iraq.  Those being called to war are the same kind of every day people who live in the 8.5 Square Mile Area.  They are not rich and powerful.  They are people who love this country and fight to protect it for democracy. What kind of  democracy is it when just because the tyranny of the majority calls for it, people are forcibly removed from their homes even if it isn't necessary?  Is ours a democracy that provides protection to people based on their wealth, privilege, and social status? I don't want to believe that. 

     One thing this battle has taught me is that minority communities with beekeepers, family farms and just plain old people like those in the 8.5 SMA are treated differently from the powerful and the rich.  I am certain that Gail Norton would not be calling for the removal of rich powerful ranchers out west.  Nor do I see her asking Dan Marino to move out of his home in Weston, which is blocking the flow of the Everglades, as opposed to the people of the 8.5 Square Mile Area which do not. 

      I have been a fact researcher for most of my life.  I found out that the only place that facts really mattered on the 8.5 SMA was before a federal judge who ruled that 6(d) was unlawful.  I must tell you, Governor Bush, that I believe that those advising you are either misinformed on the facts, or simply do not care about them.  I must also tell you that those on the Governing Board who advocated this plan and forced you into this unpalatable position of condemning Cuban exiles did you no favor.  In fact, what you are being asked to do is rescue the Corps from the Judge's decision on their unlawful plan and your appointments who came up with it in the first place. 
The national press is not as starry eyed as the Florida reporters and may one day figure out that the state of Florida got federal taxpayers to pay nearly $60 million more dollars to condemn people and buy land that wasn't necessary for Everglades restoration. 

     I too am just a little person but I was always taught to speak truth to power. I continue to believe that if you are going to make decisions that destroy familles lives that you should visit the area, look them in the eyes, and tell them that they need to go for the sake of Everglades restoration.  It is much easier to make decisions that adversely affect people when you don't have to face the human impact of that decision.  I just don't see how you could go to the 8.5 SMA, talk to the residents over Cuban coffee and still feel the same way.  I urge you to at least look at the residents on the Miccosukee Magazine tape that was given to you.  It was Julio Concepcion, the beekeeper who escaped from Cuba twice and is on the tape, who caused me to change my mind and speak against this injustice at a public meeting when I was still with Friends of the Everglades. 

      What I said at that meeting in 1998 is that 6(d) is bad for human rights, bad for the Everglades and bad for democracy.   Five years later I still feel the same way.  Mark my words, if  6(d) is improperly passed through an Interior Appropriations Bill we will all lose.  So will the Everglades.  Most important, it will not be over.  There are still the courts, which appear to be the only place that still understand the word justice.   

      God Bless You,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing on behalf of Irene Guy to support her appointment as Supervisor of Elections for Hillsborough County.  I have known Ms. Guy for more than twenty five years and had the privilege of working with her in the past and the honor of being a personal friend.  While working for Verizon Communications for more than thirty years, Irene has continued to distinguish herself in both technical and managerial career paths.  Throughout her career at Verizon, she has been recognized by her employer as a top performer and continues to be assigned to positions of greater responsibilities.  In her present capacity as Director of External Affairs, Ms. Guy has been an active board member for public and private organizations within the Tampa Bay area and has been asked to hold numerous officer positions in these organizations due to her demonstrated leadership capabilities and the professional manner in which she conducts herself.
 
While Ms. Guy has been involved with politics from her professional career, she has personally supported and been extremely active within the Republican Party.  She is very knowledgeable of political issues affecting Florida, Hillsborough County and the City of Tampa and has been active on numerous boards addressing these issues.  Her view is often sought due to her active involvement in addressing public issues and she has participated on televised political panels discussing these issues.
 
Ms. Guy is recognized as a partisan Republican and a vocal supporter of your administration and is well respected by both parties in the Hillsborough County area.  She is acknowledged as a very intelligent, focused individual who is fair in her assessment of issues and dealings with people.  She is an excellent communicator and a proven leader who has demonstrated a strong work ethic and a clear understanding of the use of technology.
 
I cannot think of a more qualified candidate in Hillsborough County for this appointment and I personally believe that she would represent not only your office but the citizens of Hillsborough County, both Democrats and Republicans, in an exceptional fashion.  Ms. Guy's impeccable credentials and history of serving the citizens of Hillsborough County qualify her as an outstanding candidate for the Supervisor of Elections position.
 
Sincerely,
 
Larry E. Williams

Commentary
By Pat Ford-Roegner

As state legislatures convene throughout the country for the 2003 session, budget deficits and slumping revenues will dominate the agenda. Many state programs will suffer cuts as lawmakers try to make our public ends meet.

One area where cuts cannot be afforded is the treatment of alcohol and drug use disorders.

Alcohol and drug treatment is already underfunded to the point that five million Americans who need treatment cannot obtain it because the health care system simply lacks the capacity to care for them.

Why is addiction treatment so poorly funded?

Individuals with alcohol and drug use disorders are often viewed as a helpless cause, a waste of resources, or unworthy of care due to their own actions.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

Chemical dependency is a real and complex disease. The misuse of drugs or alcohol extends beyond mere choice. While the path to addiction begins with the act of drug consumption, a person's ability to choose not to take drugs can be compromised. Alcohol and drugs change brain chemistry and functioning and often lead to compulsive or uncontrollable use even in the face of extremely negative consequences. 

Substance use disorders are more rightly seen as a brain disease, not a moral failure.

The good news is that alcohol and drug use disorders can be effectively treated. A study by the Physician Leadership on National Drug Policy concludes that alcohol and drug treatment is as effective as treatments for illnesses such as diabetes, asthma and hypertension.

Not only is treatment medically effective, it is cost effective.

For every dollar spent on alcohol and drug treatment at least seven dollars is saved in terms of health care costs, increased productivity, and reduction in accidents. 

The potential savings of treatment cannot be underestimated, when you consider that the annual social cost of alcohol and other drug disorders is over $300 billion.

Treatment is also better and cheaper than prison. Offenders who receive treatment as part of their sentence have lower recidivism rates than their counterparts who receive no treatment.

Unfortunately, the lack of funding for treatment is most notable in our state and federal prison systems. State officials report that 70 to 85 percent of inmates need some type of substance use disorder treatment, but less than 15 percent actually receive treatment.

As a result, we see a revolving door for people who commit crimes either on drugs or for drugs or both. Incarceration without treatment does not address addiction, it merely interrupts the cycle.

And how does the cost of treatment compare to incarceration?

Intensive inpatient alcohol or drug treatment costs roughly half of what it costs to imprison a person. And yet funding still lags.

But treatment is not only elusive for those who cannot afford insurance and those behind bars. Fully employed Americans who think they have comprehensive health care coverage also have trouble obtaining alcohol and drug treatment.

Some insurance companies offer limited or restricted alcohol and drug treatment coverage.

There are often higher co-payments and deductibles for alcohol and drug treatment. There are more stringent limits on inpatient care and outpatient treatment for addiction than for other diseases. Also, the annual and lifetime expenditure caps are more restrictive for substance use disorders than for other diseases.

In short, patients in need of alcohol and drug treatment are discriminated against based on their disease.

Given the social cost of substance use disorders and existence of effective treatment, the above facts and figures are unacceptable.

State legislatures should strengthen funding for alcohol and drug treatment and approve parity legislation that ensures equal health care coverage for all diseases. Our nation's long-term health and economic well-being depend on it.

Unfortunately, health and social service programs, including alcohol and drug treatment, are among the first cut in times of fiscal crisis. The tragic irony is that these services are most needed when the economy is slumping. An uncertain economic future means fewer jobs, less secure health coverage, and increased alcohol and drug use.

Representing the nation's frontline addictions counselors, I encourage legislators to shield alcohol and drug treatment from budget cuts. Treatment is a wise investment that yields healthier and more productive citizens.

Dear Gov.:

It is grossly apparent by now that the Kimball family's greatest desire is to connect with all families to support your vision to create an environment throughout Florida where families are strengthened and valued.

In November we read an article in our local newspaper that headlined, "Florida Develops Plan for Mass Vaccination."  It outlined the Department of Health's plan to vaccinate most of Florida's 16.4 million residents against smallpox.  Secretary of Health Dr. John Agwunobi said the challenge could be met.  Mass vaccination would be the surest way to slow an outbreak, according to some experts.

We believe we have the tool/antidote/vaccine to strengthen all Florida families in our Family Table Time kit.  A future headline could read, "Florida Develops Plan for Mass Training to Strengthen Families."  All parent, children and caregivers would be eligible for the training.  Mass training in the Family Table Time process or eating dinner together regularly would be the surest way to slow an outbreak of divorce, abuse (child, parent, and drug), births out of wedlock just to name a few.  We can build tables for those families that needs one. 

The one problem in the mass vaccination of smallpox is that up to 30 percent of the US population may be ineligible for the vaccine whereas everybody could participate in the Family Table Time training process.

Here is an article that is going out to the corporate world both nationally and internationally.   We really like the way it reads and explains our Family Table Time tool.   This is just one avenue we are pursuing.   

Here's to "the tipping point" for strengthening the Florida family.  To be continued.

Neal Kimball and family

Dear Governor,
 
    I am thinking you have already made your decision for the position of Supervisor of Elections in Hillsborough County. I know the talent pool is strong, however, if you have not, I would like to have the opportunity to come to Tallahassee and spend about five minutes telling you why new talent (specifically me) should be added to the pool of Republicans serving in this state.
 
    SouthShore is the fastest growing section of Hillsborough County. 80% of available land for potential development has a Development of Regional Impact (DRI). That means in just a few short years this part of the county will hold the key for future county wide elections. With 3 generations of ties in this community I believe I am the right person for the future.
 
    Most of the candidates seeking this position have previously served the public with several of them not being re-elected and others failing to win an election. I believe I have a wide range of support in Hillsborough County and throughout the state. I have met your new Deputy Chief of Staff, Alan Levine and even though we do not know one another very well, Mr. Levine's assistant administrator Charlie Darcy serves as president of the chamber and I believe Mr. Levine can give you a little insight into my character.
 
    I am humbled by the people who have come to me and offered their support. Last night at the 75th Anniversary Banquet of the chamber, Joe Smith of Walbridge Aldinger informed me that he will submit a letter of support. Joe and I go way back and I have much respect for this man and his family. His son Jason was my children's youth pastor for several years.
 
    I can be in Tallahassee as soon as Monday and would value the opportunity to show you why I am the right person, a person who will "provide service above self, not confusing the job with the man.
 
Sincerely,
 
Danny Kushmer

Jeb,  a couple of thoughts:
 
1.  In St. Pete, for some time we have had a "St. Pete Reads" program where the city does various things, including providing volunteers and opening up Recreation Centers at night for tutors who help children learn to read.  Other cities may do similar things and it may be good to expand the Municipal initiative to a "Mentoring and Literacy" initiative.  Frankly, I think the two overlap considerably and it may be good to merge them.
 
2.  In the Literacy program it may be effective to do a "Governor's Reading Fitness Award" similar to the "President's Physical Fitness Award" started by Kennedy.  Like the Physical Fitness Award, there would be a series of accomplishments (specified books; literary areas; quantity of books; or others) which, if completed, the student receives the award.  Your comments about the student who reads hundreds of pages a day made me think of it.  If he were a great athlete there would be lots of honors but how do we recognize our great readers?
 
3.  On February 14th I will be announcing my first nine corporate middle school partners in St. Pete.  Upon launching we will have all nine middle schools in the city matched with a corporate partner.  The commitment of the Corporation is to work with the school to help it improve, and to meet at least each semester with the principal to look for new ways to help and to see how the school is doing.  The city's role is to arrange the meetings each semester; to install plaques at the schools identifying the partnership; to provide the corporation with the FCAT scores for the schools compared to others in the county; and to provide the corporation with updated lists of what other corporate partners are doing - examples include providing mentors and tutors; serving as principal for a day; providing computers, art supplies, etc;  hosting educator awards; and others.  The partnership continues until either the school or corporation decide it is no longer working.  Once we get the middle school program up and running I intend to expand to High School and Elem.

Keep up the great work!
 
Rick

Dear Jeb:
We just wanted to give you an update on our adoption case.  First of all to again thank you for your help and for taking the time to inquire into our case.  He was finally placed on Wednesday, January 15 at about 2:00PM.  The reason for our hurry, besides the obvious reasons of having him with us permanently, was that back in December when the DCF caseworker went to give Judge Thorpe an update on our child's case, Judge Thorpe apparently became upset that after all this time he still hadn't been placed with us.  At that time (DEC 3.2002) she signed a court order stating that we needed to have him with us for overnights and weekends until all was complete.  At that time she also scheduled the finalization hearing for April 16, 2003.  If Nicholas had not been finally placed with us by this week (Wednesday at the latest) we wouldn't have met the legal requirements that he needed to be in our home for 90 days before the judge could finalize the adoption.  There would have had to have been another meeting with the judge in order to explain why the deadline wasn't met and also to schedule another finalization hearing at a later date.  As a result of the election year, and redistricting of judges we now have a new judge on the case and it was beginning to become apparent that the DCF was not as pressed to get things done.  As a matter of fact the things they were coming up with to stall the process in the final days were bordering on lunacy.
In the end, we now have our son and "all's well that ends well" as they say.  We have requested a letter from the DCF that officially states the date of placement and also the date of the hearing for finalization.  A letter which they apparently do not customarily provide adoptive parents with.  They have agreed to send us this and we should receive it sometime this coming week.  We are not sure if you want us to brief you on our whole experience or not.  If so, please let us know and we would be happy to email you all of our notes on our case from day one.
Please be assured of our prayers for you and all of your family.  We are truly grateful to have someone like you leading our state.
Sincerely,

FYI some of my thoughts, impression on Mercer's proposed rates.
 
I also wanted to mention that my e-mail to Secretary Regier was copied mostly to parents and consumers, and not providers, as I believe that providers already have a line of communication.  There were few parents and not one consumer at Fridays Redesign meeting.  
 
We also need to reach out to the 80% of providers that will not be affected by the possible rate cut.

Subject: Single Rates vs. matrix & stepped rates
 
Charm and Shelly:
 
Both of you captured an important piece that is missing from the Mercer proposed rate study: a PCA rate that is fair to all beneficiaries, including those with the most challenging disabilities, as you described in your e-mails.   While I think we were satisfied with the proposed matrix rate for res hab. services, we all seem to have a problem with the single rate structure for PCA as it relates to the Res hab matrix rate.  The proposed rate seems to encourage group home placement.   Like Charm, I am disappointed that, even though we have repeatedly addressed the need for a PCA rate that considers the challenging needs of those that have the needs that you described, our suggestions have been ignored.  While this may not have been intentional, we are disappointed that it has happened.  
 
Could it be possible for Mercer to develop a proposed rate structure in a stepped and matrix format for PCA, and other services such as Companion, ADT, Supported Employment...? The matrix format, even though more complex, seems more equitable and fair. 
 
I would also like to make a few comments on the  proposed ADT rate. The Mercer proposed daily rate (see attachment), calculated for 250 days per year, as we were told it was going to be, seems to constitute an increased rate from the current rates.  See attached District 10 Oct. 2002 ADT rates.   Note that with the exception of one provider (a faith based provider) that bills for 230 days, the remainder bill for 170 days and not 250.   This method of billing for less days than the contracted service days has always been an issue of concern for many of us.  I recall some providers billing for the 170 days up-front, which when/if an individual changed provider, the funding was sometimes either not sufficient to cover the cost of the new provider for the remainder of the cost plan year, or it was completely spent.  Some WSC had to request additional funding to cover for the service with the new provider.   On the current rates, note that with the exception of two individual rates of $11,820.10 (for 3 hrs. per day) and $26,191.90 (6 hrs per day), the ADT rates in my district fluctuate from $3,957.00 to $8,037.00 per year.  The majority of the rates are on the range of $5,000.00 to $6,000.00 per year.  Why, then, are we proposing a new rate range of $9,000.00 to $10,000.00 and $25,000.00 for individual rates?  This without any consideration to the number of service hrs. per day.  A matrix rate for this service should be explored.  
 
On the other hand, the proposed supported employment rate is a simple rate, which even though it may appear higher due to the per hourly rate instead of daily rate, it doesn't take into consideration the needs of those individuals that may need a more intense service due to the intensity of their challenging issues.   The proposed rate structure among ADT and supportive employment also seems to favor ADT, specially as it relates to individuals with more significant challenges.
 
I understand the Redesign team will be meeting before the end of the month.  I do not know when is the meeting scheduled for, but if at all possible, I will appreciate if it can be on 1/27.  With the exception of this coming Monday and Tuesday, the only other day this month that I do not have an out of town scheduled meeting is next Monday 1/27/03.  For a conference call, I am available this coming Tuesday or any day in the weekend.  Please let me know.
 
Berthy

Hi Charm,
 
We can make arrangements to set aside a couple hours for families and
consumers before the entire stakeholder group meets on the 28th. We realize
that families and consumers have multiple demands and hectic schedules so we
can hopefully accomodate more people if we do everything on the same day or
the day before. 
 
In regards to the tiered rate model, this would not require a new rule
making process. We could incorporate this as part of the proposed rate
structure. In other words, we can make changes based on public input, such
as yours, before we promulgate the final rate structure into rule. 
 
Thank you all for your unflagging determination and  commitment to the
program redesign.  Our ability to work together is paramount to our success.

Thanks Shelly,
 
I like your idea about a separate conference call or meeting before the next
meeting.  I know I can come in the afternoon before the next scheduled
redesign meeting but I'm not sure about others, but I would like to get
together one way or the other.   Can someone arrange it? Let me know if
there's anything I can do.
 
Because Florida does not have a tiered model, and if the decision is to
adopt a model, would it have to go thru any separate promulgation process or
would it be included as a part of Mercer's recommendation for the redesign
and become a  part of the rates promulgation process?
 
Thank you all for working with consumers and families.  Your hard work and
commitment to the redesign is apparent and I know that the end result will
make a positive impact in the health and quality of  life for individuals
with developmental disabilities.   Together we will  make a difference.

Charm,
 
Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding single rates. Berthy expressed
similar concerns after the meeting and we have asked Mercer to develop some
alternatives. I have suggested that Mercer develop a tiered model similar to
North Carolina's Medicaid state plan PCA service. The model basically
describes and reimburses 3 different levels of PCA services based on the
individual's need, abilities and limitations. Each level is described by the
intensity of PCA services needed.
 
Due to boarder nursing delegation laws in NC, Florida would need a model
which excludes any skilled PCA care unauthorized by FL's nurse practice act.
We need a model which compensates based on the level of assistance needed
for daily living activities such as bathing, feeding, bowel and bladder care
and physical activity (especially heavy lifting and transfers) as well as
behavioral management. The PCA's ability and willingness to perform such
activities is rarely attributed to a formal professional competency level
(such as certification as a nursing assistance), but rather the PCA's
"hands-on " work experience, willingness to learn and receive parent
training, physical abilities, behavioral management skills and overall
understanding of  the individual with developmental disabilities.  
 
I have attached a weblink to the NC personal care manual for some IDEAS
ONLY, but we can simplify the model for purposes of reimbursement. Again,
the intent is to describe PCA in a manner which compensates for different
levels of need/intensity of care.
http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/dma/mp/mpindex.htm 
 
In an effort to ensure family and self advocates have ample time to express
any concerns or share ideas relating to single rates, perhaps we should
consider a separate conference call with just families and consumers prior
to the next meeting and/or set aside an hour or 2 before the stakeholder
meeting for this purpose.

Subject: Single Rates
 
 
Dear Norm and John,
 
I have a MAJOR concern regarding your recommendation of single rates.
 
As family members expressed at the end of the day yesterday, we were not
given time to discuss the methodology of Single Rates.
 
You stated today that "in home supports" was one of 3 areas that you were
focusing your energies on to create incentive and encourage development.
That was good news.
 
I did not see a higher rate adjustment for individuals who have significant
care needs such as, lifting, feeding incontinence, behavior etc.  For
example, the rate for PCA is  $16.66/Agency, $13.35/Independent provider.
There is no incentive (higher rate of pay) in place to encourage providers
to serve a non-ambulatory /high needs consumer.
 
If providers are paid the same amount for all DD individuals, they will
choose to provide care to the consumer who requires less work.
 
As you know, this has been a concern of mine throughout this whole exercise,
which I have expressed repeatedly, on numerous occasions.  You have assured
all of us, repeatedly, that you are very much aware of that concern and that
it will be addressed.  As far as I can see it has not been addressed.  I
feel like I have been ignored.  So, once again I am reminding you that it is
very important that a higher rate for individuals with significant needs be
identified.
 
Without these changes you will NOT be supporting the development of "in home
supports", as you claim, but encouraging congregate and institutional living
situations for individuals with significant needs and discouraging the
involvement and contributions of families and community.
 
What exactly is the higher rate you propose to pay providers who will
provide in home support services to consumers who have higher complex needs?
 
Have a great weekend.
 
Sincerely,
 
Charm  Thometz

Despiden a defensor de programas bilinguee 
--------------------

By Walter Pacheco
El Sentinel

January 11, 2003

El Departamento de Educacion de Florida recientemente despidio uno de los defensores de los derechos de los estudiantes latinos en los programas bilinguees.

Para muchos padres latinos en el condado de Orange, la expulsion de Bernardo Garcia, el ex director del Negociado de Equidad, Seguridad y Apoyo Escolar y uno de los pocos hispanos de alto rango en Educacion, indica un atraso en los programas bilinguees.

Garcia, un cubano de 61 anos, dirigia los programas de educacion bilinguee y de estudiantes que no dominan el ingles.

Todo esto ocurre en un momento cuando muchas de las escuelas publicas a traves de EEUU demuestran deficiencias en la educacion de las minorias, segun informes.

"[Garcia] siempre abogaba por los derechos de nuestros estudiantes latinos en los programas bilinguees de Orange. Ahora, ?que pasara?", pregunto Evelyn Rivera, la presidenta del Concejo de Liderazgo de Padres de Florida.

Fue despedido en diciembre pasado durante una reunion en Tallahassee tocante a los fallos en los programas bilinguees en las escuelas de Orange.

"Me vinieron a buscar durante la reunion y me dijeron que no regresara. Alli mismo me despidieron sin razon", dijo Garcia.

Educacion no devolvio llamadas a El Sentinel.

Su despedida no ha sido el unico cambio en Educacion. Tambien despidieron a 64 administradores como parte de una reorganizacion.

En 1998 los electores votaron para que la Junta de Directores de Educacion sean nombrados por el gobernador y no elegidos por los votantes. Ahora, Educacion esta completamente bajo el control del gobernador Jeb Bush.

Garcia vigilaba como los distritos escolares realizaban sus programas bilinguees, que es de gran importancia ya que, segun un informe anual sobre la educacion de las minorias en las escuelas publicado esta semana por Education Week, los estados buscan satisfacer un area o programa especifico, pero no le dan seguimiento para determinar su efectividad.

En Orange, los resultados de las investigaciones de los programas bilinguees despertaron interes publico donde antes no existia.

"Espero que alguien continue los esfuerzos en la administracion de estos programas", dijo Gloria Esteban, del Consejo de Asesoria Hispana de Orange.

Algunos padres latinos piensan que los cambios a nivel estatal provocaran consecuencias en Orange.

Carmen Sotolongo, madre de una estudiante que asiste a la escuela intermedia Stonewall Jackson, dijo que a traves de las auditorias y sus numerosas presentaciones frente a la Junta Escolar del Condado de Orange, Garcia demostro las deficiencias en las escuelas publicas.

"Estos problemas son graves y los padres necesitan saber lo que esta pasando. Sin alguien como [Garcia] dirigiendo este movimiento, nos quedaremos en la oscuridad", dijo Sotolongo.

Ahora, el futuro de los programas bilinguees esta en el limbo.

Segun Joan First, la directora de la Coalicion Nacional de Defensores de Estudiantes, en Boston, Garcia fomentaba "fe en las escuelas publicas de Florida, orgullo familiar y la esperanza de un futuro mejor".

"Algunas personas me llaman por telefono y me cuentan que estan desilusionadas. El siempre demostro su obligacion a estas personas y sus hijos y ahora ellos no saben que pasara", dijo First.

    Dear Gov. Jeb,
    Hopefully, we can keep Frank Brogan as your Lt. Gov--he is outstanding.
    But if he goes to FAU, you will need to appoint a new person.
    This email is to recommend JENNIFER CARROLL for the job.  She would be
terrific.  Some reasons why this is a good idea are:
    1.  Jennifer has the character and the ability to do an excellent job;
she would represent you and our state well.
    2.  She would be the first woman Lt. Gov. in Florida.
    3.  She would be the first African- American Lt. Gov. in the U.S. (I
think).
    4.  Her appointment would take some of the sting out of all of the
negative Affirmative Action publicity.
    5.  Her appointment would help to prove to African-Americans that you
are sincere, and our party is sincere, when we say we are the party of
inclusion.
   I hope and pray that you will appoint her.  May God continue to bless
you.  Remember that the republicans of Alachua County  are still solidly

Celebration?"


"Black Community Seeks County Mayor's Ouster As King
Day Parade Grand Marshall" 

BY ELGIN JONES

HALLANDALE- The Broward Times has learned that a group
of residents, led by members of the black clergy, have
notified Hallandale officials of their intentions not
to participate in the city's Martin Luther King Day
parade or other celebrations if Broward County mayor
Diana Wasserman-Rubin attends or remains as the
parade's Grand Marshall.

This latest controversy related to that city's King
Day festivities comes just days before the events are
scheduled to take place. Last week city residents
objected to former mayor Arnold Lanner being the
recipient of the city's inaugural Martin Luther King,
Jr Humanitarian Award. Among other things, while
sitting on the commission, Lanner once referred to the
predominently black northwest area as a "rat hole."

Wasserman-Rubin, whose district includes portions of
Hallandale, Hollywood and the Carver Ranches area, led
a failed attempt to have Gov. Jeb Bush oust Broward
County Supervisor of Elections Miriam Oliphant this
week. This raised the ire of the black electorate and
now, it appears it may be Wasserman-Rubin who is
ousted as a result her stand against Oliphant. 

"On behalf of the MLK day, I did not want the event to
be downtrodden and the dream forgotten," said Rev.
Josh Brown, a Hallandale community activist and
chairman of the city's King Day committee. Brown
acknowledged he had heard from residents and members
of the Broward Ministerial Alliance, which is a
coalition of black pastors representing several
churches, who have objected to Wasserman-Rubin's
participation or attendance at the celebrations.

Last week, another popular black minister, Bishop
Victor Curry, said on his radio talk show that if
Wasserman-Rubin attends this, or any other black
oriented events in the south county area, he and his
congregations would withdraw their participation and
support from such events.

The Broward Ministerial Alliance has reportedly
informed city officials they would resort to protests
of Hallandale's day of events if Wasserman-Rubin is
not barred from participating in those festivities.
"I've expressed my concerns to all parties and I am
waiting for an answer," stated Rev. Brown when asked
if he had asked Wasserman-Rubin to withdraw herself as
Grand Marshall.

Brown said, as chairman of the King Day Committee, he
simply forwarded the concerns that were brought to his
attention to city officials and would not express a
personal position on the controversy. He did say there
have been preliminary discussions to have black city
resident John Saunders replace Wasserman-Rubin as
Grand Marshall. Saunders was the first and only black
ever elected to office in Hallandale. The Broward
Times is continuing it's attempts to reach
Wasserman-Rubin for comment.

Dear sir:
     I am writing you to tell you that Fran Gronzalas
with DCF in Lake City, Florida is not protecting my 
granddaughter Cheyenne Hope O'Neal.  When Wendy O'Neal
saw my granddaughter, Friday she has a bruisesl bruses
on her face.  When she asked what was going on she was
told that she had gotten this when she took her to her
therapist.  Cheyenne is only two and has NEVER been 
told from any doctor she needs to go to a therapist.
Also Wendy is supposed to be told of ANY appointments
and this foster parent is not informing anyone of
this.
I demand as a grandparent for DCF is investigate
immediately and correct this now, I am going to notify
everyone what has happened.  This is going to be done
so that if this is not taken care of, someone will
know
that our GOVERNMENT as usual is not doing anything.
I have trepeatilyepeatily that this is going on.  DCF
is putting my grandchildren at risk by not putting 
them at home with their mother where they belong.
Are you going to do something NOW.  Now that you, by
not stepping in have allowed my granddaughter to get 
hurt.  I need your help now.

The Holidays are behind us now and I would like to congratulate you on your inauguration for 2003.  My next door neighbors were in attendance and invited to your chambers and all were impressed, the girls love the coins.
 
I am writing regarding the pre-school classes and will put my 2 cents worth in.  Pre schoolers can not be housed in portable classrooms as they do not have the most important component necessary for a pre school class a bathroom. I have taught in a portable classroom and they are not conducive to learning i.e. too hot or too cold stairs not available to handicapped and once again for older students the bathroom.
 
I wish also the mention the Workforce issue.  having a computer available in a room is not helpful in procuring a job for anyone.  The CHF and Workforce were formerly in the same building and I must go to CHF for my clients regularly and observed the people attempting to utilize the 'Workforce" computers, they have no conseling, no instruction in the use of a computer.  The people that I observed needed to have someone instruct them on the use of the equipment or at least have instructions available to follow directions.  These folks need a training center to become involved in the work force a Technical or Vocational center before they go to prison not after they get there.
 
I will hate to see Brogan leave political office.

this note in support or recommendation for Ms. Janet Kovach.  Ms. Kovach
is a very well qualified person with an impressive resume and she has
worked very hard on behalf of the Republican Party.  She is a very
dedicated person who has worked for many elected and Party Officials.
Moreover, it is time to have a well qualified Republican  Woman assume

We hope you will give her qualifications a serious look.

Hey and happy new year.  Judy & I couldn't get close to you during the Ball

That's okay, we'll have plenty of opportunities in the ensuing four years.

Two questions:

1.)  I handed you some pictures for autographs on December 17 (Christmas 
Party).........haven't see them yet. Sure would like to getthem to the 
intended parties.

2.) A local Pharmacist is looking at a Board of Pharmacy Vacancy.  He was 
appointed to ( 2) prior terms and served them out.  His question 
is.......would you be willing to consider him for the current vacancy?  He's 
a good guy - his wife was a volunteer during the 2000 recount and was on our 
local team for 2002.

Please advise me on each of these and I will act accordingly.

I did not print across the top the message that needs to go on it ("The, presenters did not show up nor did they call." ...or  something to that effect.  You can boldly print whatever you think it should say-you know jeb better than I do!! You don't need to use my name. Reese and I have more than quadruple the number of training hours needed so we graciously agreed to stay home and babysit other foster parents children so that they could go.  The group waited until 9:oo and still no one showed.  Tom Waltz, our local dcf licensing person was there, but no one from Lakeview ever showed up---perhaps they got caught in a snowstorm between Fort Walton and Pensacola  and their cell phones died. Please tell me that I am not making too much of this.  Lakeview will probably come and slash my tires as it is now, but it is for the kids and we have to stick our necks out even if they get chopped off.    sally

Dear anne and gene, I just read one of my historical newspapers and see that your son, chris is a HELICOPTER PILOT!!!!  I am so impressed!!! He certainly doesn't have to take a back seat to ANYONE-WOW-you must be  SOOOO PROUD1111                                                                                                 ...also, I am just so thrilled that you and gene with your compassion and expertise want to participate. I know you are wondering if rose is involved and the answer is no, hell no-it would never get finished!!!.. she doesn't even know anything about it and neither does COPE . We don't' want any of rose's or COPE'S input or interference-this is going to be a model for the state to follow if I have anything to do with it  Did I tell you that Lakeview-Baptist hospital had a training and information session for all of the foster parents from okaloosa-walton county on Thursday, January 9 at OWCC?? Most of the foster parents got a letter with the agenda, etc and if we had any questions, concerns, etc. their team would stand at the ready to clarify anything and everything. A few foster parents did not get the letter because not everyone is in their database yet???? Lakeview, as you may recall, is the agency that won the bid to run the dcf  under its privatization on November 1, 2002 and everyone isn't in the database yet, hence not everyone got the letter??? We are not talking about gazillions  of entries for only four counties and they already have many of escambia and santa rosa foster chiildren as clients!..now for the kicker...approximately 41 foster parents and a few dcf personnel attended and were waiting and waiting and LAKEVIEW NEVER DID SHOW UP THE ENTIRE NIGHT and THEY  called the meeting and even sent out letters!!! Lakeview is the newly-privatized head of the department of children and families.  I think that the governor needs to hear about this. I want to take the lakeview invitation letter and send it to him and write right across the top that the seminar presenters did not even show up nor did they call nor did they send correspondence of any type.  About a week ago on TV, Jeb said that he was so pleased with how the privatization is going and is looking forward to when Medicaid and food stamps are privatized.  Someone needs to tell him that privatization is for profit and not for children-no one wants to seem to want to make waves. These  are innocent children and foster parents that are trying to give the children their "fifteen minutes of fame" as the saying goes. Walton county needs this type of home and if it is at all possible, I want to be part of the group to make it happen as soon as possible!!!! Thank you in advance for your support....sally

Subject:	Florida’s abortion rate is rising; almost half the procedures are in S. Florida

From: Jeff

NOW how do you feel about your adoption law?

--------------------
Florida's abortion rate is rising; almost half the procedures are in S. Florida 
--------------------

By Nancy McVicar
Health Writer

January 20, 2003

As the 30th anniversary of legal abortion approaches, abortion rates nationwide have declined to their lowest levels since 1974. But in Florida, the rate is rising, and Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties account for almost half the abortions performed in the state.

Several factors could be contributing to the increase, said Donna Barber, executive director of the Florida Association of Planned Parenthood Affiliates in Tallahassee.

"It could be that abortion clinics are more accessible, or it could be because the state family planning budget has decreased and not as many women are getting family planning help," Barber said.

"Last year, a million and a half dollars was taken out of the state's family planning program and moved to the abstinence program," she said. "The budget wasn't big enough to start with, only serving about 26 percent of the women in need in the state. It would be nice if people practiced abstinence, but I don't know how you stop people from having sex."

Barber said the women most in need of help are not getting information about birth control methods, especially women working in low-paying jobs without health insurance or family doctors.

Bill Parizek, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Health, said no one at the department tracks abortions, except to gather data for its Vital Statistics reports on births and deaths, but that access to family planning services has not been cut.

"I know we have $7.1 million in family planning and $5.7 million in abstinence programs," Parizek said. "There's been no changes to pregnancy prevention access in many years."

According to a report issued on Wednesday by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the national abortion rate has dropped to 21.3 abortions per every 1,000 women, the lowest rate since 1974. But in 2000, the most recent year for which statistics have been compiled, the rate in Florida was 31.9 per 1,000, up from 29 in 1995.

Parizek said the state does not ask for residency information, so it is possible people are coming to Florida from states with tougher abortion regulations, which could skew the state's abortion rate.

The Guttmacher Institute, with offices in Washington, D.C., and New York, is a nonprofit organization for sexual and reproductive health research, and its reports are frequently quoted by both sides of the abortion debate.

The institute's study showed how prevalent abortion is in America today.

Of the almost 6.3 million pregnancies each year in the United States, 48 percent were unintended, according to the report. Almost half of those, 47 percent, ended in abortion.

The most frequent reasons women give for seeking abortions is that they can't afford to care for a child -- 21 percent. Another 21 percent say they aren't ready for the responsibility, the report said.

Joyce Tarnow, who runs the Women's Clinic in Lauderhill, which has offered abortions for 25 years, said most of the women who need the clinic's services are not practicing birth control.

"Most people weren't using a contraceptive method when they got pregnant, or they'll say they were on the pill, but ran out," Tarnow said. "They're not keeping menstrual calendars."

She said the majority of women seeking abortions aren't teenagers and won't be swayed by arguments about abstinence as a means of preventing pregnancy.

"Our patient population is mostly from the early 20s up and as late as 45-48," she said. "We have seen kids as young as 11, but we don't have very many teenagers. We've never seen a lot of teenagers."

More abortion clinics

While some states have had a reduction in the number of abortion clinics and physicians who will perform the procedure, Florida has had an increase -- 68 licensed abortion clinics, the highest number since 1990, and at least another 40 physicians and hospitals that offer abortion services.

The Guttmacher survey found that 103,050 abortions were performed in Florida in 2000, with 108 physicians or clinics offering abortion services.

The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, which licenses abortion clinics, reported 85,589 pregnancies terminated at Florida abortion clinics in 2001. Almost half -- 41,925 -- were in three South Florida counties.

Miami-Dade County had 22,272 abortions, Broward County had 13,193, and Palm Beach County had 6,460, according to state health officials.

Unlike the Guttmacher survey, AHCA's numbers do not include private physicians who offer abortion procedures.

A bill pre-filed for the 2003 Legislature by Sen. Anna P. Cowin, R-Leesburg, would allow the state to write regulations that must be followed by abortion clinics.

"They're not held to the same standards as ambulatory surgery centers or in-office surgeries," Cowin said on Friday.

Cowin said she opposes abortion, but her reason for introducing the bill is to hold abortion clinics to the same standards as other places performing similar procedures.

"I'm not trying to do anything that would be more restrictive," Cowin said. "I just think we should be more protective of our women."

Clinic operators said new regulations are unnecessary and could add costs that would drive some out of business or force them to charge more for the procedures.

"It's called the Women's Health and Safety Act, and it sounds pretty innocuous," said Carolyn Pardue, a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood in Florida. "But they're not trying to make it safer for women, they're trying to make it harder for women. They're trying to regulate clinics out of business."

Mona Reis, president of Presidential Women's Center in West Palm Beach, said the clinics already are licensed and regulated and that the procedure is very safe.

"This is very frightening. Most people sitting in the Florida Legislature have no idea how outstanding the care is, and they're going to be misled by this misconception of what abortion facilities are like," Reis said. "This strategy has been used across the country to create burdensome, unnecessary regulations with the motivation to close down abortion facilities."

The Abortion Pill

With approval of the abortion pill by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September 2000, and availability of the drug, Mifeprex, later that year, a growing number of women are opting to use it rather than the surgical method to end pregnancies.

Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, said 75 percent of the organization's members are offering the abortion pill.

"At about 30 percent of our sites, as many as a third of women are choosing to have a medical abortion," Saporta said. She did not have specific numbers for Florida.

Danco Laboratories, the company that makes the pill called Mifeprex, said this week that more than 130,000 U.S. women have used the "early-option" pill to date.

Saporta said if abortion were to be banned in the United States, the pill would not be an option, though doctors might still have access to it for other uses.

"The majority of people in this country still are firmly pro-choice and do not think the government should be making these decisions," Saporta said. "There is no mandate to turn back reproductive rights because women's health and lives would be in jeopardy."

Yet women's health advocates say they are worried.

"It's war on women," said Mary Capobianco, president of Planned Parenthood of South Palm Beach and Broward Counties. "The personal belief systems of the president and the governor are interfering with what the general public wants."

Barbara Herring, of the Pro-Choice Coalition of Broward County, helped plan a Roe v. Wade 30th anniversary observance for Wednesday evening in Fort Lauderdale's Huizenga Plaza, at Andrews Avenue and Las Olas Boulevard. Herring said the program is aimed at educating young people about what happened before Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that made abortion legal.

Herring worked as a nurse in maternity wards in Massachusetts in the 1960s when birth control was illegal.

"Doctors were not allowed to give diaphragms or birth control pills because of something called the Comstock Law. I was a maternity supervisor, and sometimes it was very sad seeing people who didn't really want to have children because they couldn't afford to, or children born severely deformed, who didn't survive. But the woman had to endure the pregnancy and go through that. I would never want to see us go back to that," she said.

Hey, Jeb,

Happy New Year and best wishes for what appears to be a challenging year in
Tallahassee.  Citrus County came through for you, again, with 61.4% of the
vote and a 69.5% Republican turnout--excellent for a non-Presidential
election cycle.

Please give serious consideration to this letter I am forwarding.  It speaks
for itself.  This is a very important celebration and one that I would think
you and Mrs. Bush would want to attend.  This event is a year and a half
away.  I hope this gives you the kind of  "lead time"  necessary to schedule
it.

The folks in Citrus don't get a chance to see you as much as they wish, and
this would provide an opportunity to do just that.

Thank you,

Sam Lyons

Subject:	Prison treatment

Dear Governor Bush:
Since you have taken office the mission statement for the Department of Corrections has been changed to: Safe, Humane, and Efficient.  

I see that it is not gummed up by any high ideals of rehabilitation and preparation of inmate return to society.  Our prisons have become nothing more than human holding cells housing oppressed people, serving extended time, without any means of correction or redemption.

Being a prisoner in Florida means being hungry.  In the name of efficiency the state has given the contract to a company offering food for pennies a day.  I had an inmate write that said the meat served just covered the bowl of his teaspoon.  He was given the choice to eat it or not.

It means shivering in the cold.  The DOC does not have enough warm clothing or bedding to issue this winter.  A deficiency of long johns, of underwear, of warm sox, or lined jackets means being chilled to the bone.  

Being in Florida's prison system means having a greatly diminished future. Inmates have little opportunity to learn a trade or a job skill since most of our prison programs have been cut in the name of efficiency.

It might mean a toothache because the dental care is backlogged from six months to a year.

It could mean that medical treatment is withheld, as in the case of my son, delayed until it was too late to operate.

It means living in a hostile environment because the officers and guards are low paid, under trained, and emotionally stressed.  Being an inmate in Florida means being personally degraded, dehumanized, and threatened by DOC staff with an absolute power that runs unchecked and unquestioned.  

Safety or security only pertains to Correctional officers and staff, concern for safety doesn't include inmates.  Inmates can be raped, or beaten, or gassed, or set up for false charges, and no one in Florida's administration cares.

Contrary to the present philosophy of Florida, statistics show that the opportunities for rehabilitation, and how an offender is treated while incarcerated, makes more of a difference to recidivism than length of sentence.  Education, vocational and drug programs are shown to decrease the likelihood of return to prison.  

Florida continues to in-force serving longer sentences, with less and less rehabilitation.  This has not been effective here, or in other states.  We need to make changes.

COMMENT: It seems that some people still don't get.  You just don't care!
=============================================================
Jeb Is Making Big Mistake Undercutting Growth Controls

Tampa Tribune Editorial
Published: Jan 19, 2003 

Gov. Jeb Bush has initiated a restructuring of the state's growth management system that seems certain to undermine Florida's ability to control growth. 
The governor wants to merge the Department of Community Affairs, the state's growth agency, into the secretary of state's office. 
It's a bewildering effort, one that the governor failed to discuss during his re- election campaign. That is no surprise. Voters likely would have been suspicious of a plan that appears designed to diminish controls on the irresponsible development that ultimately forces citizens to pay heavy costs - either in additional taxes or in a lower quality of life. 
The two agencies have nothing in common. The secretary of state's office oversees elections and cultural and historical events and registers businesses. The Department of Community Affairs coordinates local growth plans and emergency preparedness. 
To contend, as the Bush administration does, that the departments should be wedded because they both deal with communities is insulting. The same can be said of just about every state agency. 
What's more, throwing these two disparate efforts together could result in a cumbersome, unresponsive bureaucracy in which the state's planning responsibilities would be all but lost. 
The whole scheme is unsettling and revives questions about Bush's commitment to managing growth. In his first race for governor, the former developer seemed unenthusiastic about Florida's growth management laws. But after losing that election and spending the next few years traveling the state to observe its needs, Bush seemed to moderate his views. He acknowledged the necessity of regulations to keep construction from ruining resources and overwhelming infrastructure. But, characteristic of politicians who want to minimize government, he thought the growth management process should be streamlined - a reasonable position. 
And Bush has consistently held that the state should focus on major growth impacts and leave minor matters strictly to local officials. While this seems sensible, neighborhood groups and conservationists fear the governor would retreat from all growth decisions except for a few high-profile cases. Bush says that is not his intent. But his dismantling of Community Affairs is not reassuring. 
Florida's history shows that some state oversight is essential. Local governments are to blame for most of Florida's countless planning disasters, including the smothering of the Florida Keys, the dangerous overdevelopment of barrier islands, and the siting of a cement plant near Ichetucknee Springs State Park. 
The Danger Of Corruption 
With influential interests promising jobs and other immediate benefits, local officials often ignore a project's long- term consequences. And sometimes corruption is at work, as longtime Hillsborough residents well know. In the 1980s, several county commissioners on the take made decisions that forever changed the county's landscape. 
State involvement provides safeguards against such abuse. 
The governor may be correct that the growth management process needs to be revamped to eliminate excessive red tape. Other changes may also be justified. But eliminating the Department of Community Affairs is a terrible mistake. Destroying the state's development watchdog serves only to raise fears about the state's future.

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
Many people have been working together in the ECE/UPK Workgroup coordinated by Phyllis Kalefih at the Florida Children's Forum and our facilitator Susan Wilkinson, Episcopal Children's Services.  I appreciated meeting Teresa Tinker, Barbara Hoagland and Sherri Joyner from your office.
 
I also met with Commissioner Horne on January 9th and shared some thoughts about where we have been in PreK in Forida and where we are planning to go to prepare children for literacy skills and the "No Child Left Behind" initiative. 
 
Many people have asked how public schools are providing Prek programs. I wanted to share this email with you . 
 
Carol Barnett has been instrumental in Polk County and in the state and nation on the Success by 6 
core values. We support you on your literacy and reading initiatives. Please call on me if you would like for me explain our program. You are always invited to come to Polk County and see school readiness in action!

Dear Commissioner Horne, 
Since we met on 1/9, several things have come up that I want to share with you, as you plan for PreK transition next year. I know you are busy, so I will try to be brief!  I  hope you can read the last CLIP Teaching tykes. In case you can't access it from my email, Alex Amengual, Partnership Staff, can send it to you. alex.amengual@school readiness.org 
This recertification of  Prek children is happening statewide to the PreK school district school sites and our contracted child care center sites. As you and I discussed,  the Polk School District and other school districts believe in contracting out to private child care centers up to 50% of the spaces for the Prek children. Before you read about recertification, I need to share a question that some have asked  about the value of contracting with school districts. 
 
Sherri Joyner from the Governor's office asked me to email her why I think school districts are  the agency to contract out  PreK, not only to school sites but to contracted child care sites. I shared the following:
"Quality Initiatives" are the key. When F.S.230  was initiated, Polk School District  contracted out 42% of the Prek program and since F.S. 411, we continue to contract. After all, the children will be coming to kindergarten next year and this is a collaboration among all providers. A  few examples we offer to our contracted sites  in Polk: 
1.The public schools can offer a free hot lunch every day from an area cafeteria. 
2.We provide "take home libraries". We give each child 5 books to keep so parents can read to their children, at home. This is the literacy component and "No child Left Behind" mindset.
3.We provide a registered nurse to each contracted child care prek site and school site. Polk has 56  Prek sites. Each nurse, through a  prek school readiness fund contract with the Polk Health Department, oversees 7 sites each. 
...I will be glad to discuss more quality initiatives that school districts provide, if I can help explain further.
 The reason I share "quality initiatives" is I think many people who don't deal with this every day, do not realize how valuable the school districts have been and continue to be in school readiness. We see the value of literacy and we can offer training, workshops and seminars to all providers, whether they contract with us or not.  I am interested in contracting for 4 year olds at the school district. Our Superintendent Jim Thormhill and our Polk County School Board support us in this effort. Other agencies are highly qualified to provide early education and care to children 0-4 and school-age. 
 
 The following is my report from the field!  ; }
 Nanette Rodgers

 
This email  is from our FYA Central agency Director, Juanita Tomson, who has to send out the letters to POLK school board prek parents(because we have to be subsidized brokers of care now) every 6 months.

 
This CLIP below :  number 4  TEACHING  TYKES  has  letters sent out every three months. Some 4 C's  are sending recertification letters out once a year(Pam Davis, BIG Ben 4C sends out once a year).
 
SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHAT WE SHOULD DO. I have always wanted once a year. Our YFA feels they will be breaking the law if they do not send recertification letters out every 6 months. Marina Harkness told me the day YFA sent out  the letters, some central agencies are operating under the old DCandF Rules.... which there are no rules!!!  We understand the Partnership will not be voting on the Rules on Thursday.
 
Last week, over 400 recertification letters were sent out to our Polk Prek parents to recertify in February!!! 
First of all, the letter is 4 pages and some parents panic because they can't read forms well or don't think they need to send  all the information again. They are scared or don't want to go through all the hassle again and are dropping out. The children suffer. We finally have 931 enrolled and we are all frantically trying to encourage parents to stay and we will help them recertify.  This article confirms our dilemma.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
 
     Thanks for your commitment to protect the Guana Wildlife Management Area in St. Johns County.  The people of the State of Florida paid a lot of money to protect this area from the pressures of development.  Please do not allow any of the land to be given for roads or rightways or other infrastructure.  As I have stated many times, there is a lack of official responsibility in planning for St. Johns County on the local level.  I understand that there may be plans to trade away the Guana Area with other lands.  There may be excuses used such as public safety in an effort to take away the preserved public land.  Public safety can be ensured by not allowing overdevelopment in any area.
 
     Thanks once again.

On January 15th you had an interview with Warren Zimmerman who is a candidate for circuit court in Hillsborough County.  I have known him for several years, and he is a dedicated public servant.  His most impressive credential is his varied background - commercial, criminal, governmental, etc.  It would be beneficial to our judicial system to have more judges with Warren's background who have a depth of knowledge and experience in several areas of the law.

State cuts may hurt disabled programs 

Local human services providers say the cuts may affect present developmentally disabled clients the most. 

By Michael Peltier staff writer

TALLAHASSEE -- Local human services officials are scrambling to respond to a statewide edict that may force them to cut services for the area's developmentally disabled to make up for $13.4 million statewide shortfall. 

State officials are giving regional districts until next month to make their case on why they should not be required to roll back rates or cut programs to trim budgets that state officials say were exceeded during the first half of fiscal 2003. 

Local providers, however, say the deficit comes in large part to previous shortfalls, unrealistic projections and higher than expected client costs. 

They also say poor fiscal oversight by state officials in Tallahassee has exacerbated the problem. 

For District 15, which coordinates programs in a region including Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin counties, providers were asked earlier this month to cut $722,278 from their budgets over the next six months. 

Such providers serve about 750 clients in the region, including 150 in Indian River County. 

Newly appointed Department of Children and Families Secretary Jerry Regier has postponed threatened cuts until at least Jan. 15 as the department tries to fill a deficit created largely by obligations carried over from last year. 

More than $9 million of the shortfall statewide is from bills carried over from last year, when lawmakers chose to use non-recurring funds to pay for recurring programs. Coupled with higher than expected treatment costs, district officials now find themselves in a $13.4 million hole. 

Local service providers, whose services range from group home care to assisted living and after-school programs, say that existing clients may be most dramatically affected because lawmakers have also required them to reduce waiting lists of people seeking services. 

Like many of his fellow providers, Roger Baker must seek private sources to augment state and federal funds to make ends meet. 

Talk that local providers are charging too much and responsible for the shortfall is absurd, says Baker, the executive director of ARC of Indian River County. 

"These cuts would have a direct impact on client services," said Roger Baker, executive director of the ARC of Indian River County. "When you're already only receiving funding for 80 percent of the cost of services, how can they say that your rates are too high?" 

"If I am going to have to cut rates, I'm going to have to cut services, too; it's that simple," said John Gonzalez, CEO of ARC of Martin County, which provides services for 125 clients. 

Local provider were warned earlier this month when they received a memo from DCF Deputy Secretary Lucy Hadi alerting them that cuts would be necessary. State DCF officials had only been aware of the shortfall for a couple weeks prior to the Dec. 3 memo. 

Last year, DCF officials received an additional $10 million to fill a gap in current year funding. The amount, it turns out, was inadequate to handle the swelling client ranks. 

"We're not trying to do a bad thing here, but we have a constitutional prohibition here in Florida for deficit spending," Hadi told the Press Journal earlier this month. "We can't spend more than we have appropriated. What we're trying to do now is to bring our expenses in line with what the appropriation is." 

Following a flurry of concern from local providers, however, state officials have held a series of conference calls and have scheduled a meeting for mid-January between the department and local providers to study options. 

"We're going to have to find ways to review the cases and see if there are services that might no longer be necessary," Hadi said. "A lot of things that we are going to have to do is just a lot of hard work."

let me try again. I agree. I would add that the cynicism that pervades the press, while healthy in many cases, spills over into a dangerous area. For example (not the only one), the perception of the whiff of the possibility of conflict seems to pervasive but real conflicts seem to be left alone. 
 
Thanks, Gary for sending the excellent article.

By DAVID SHAW 
"The news media are biased." It's the most common complaint I've heard throughout my career as a journalist. And it's true: The news media are biased.

We're biased in favor of change, as opposed to the status quo. We're biased in favor of bad news, rather than good news. We're biased in favor of conflict rather than harmony.

Increasingly, we're biased in favor of sensationalism, scandal, celebrities and violence, as opposed to serious, insightful coverage of the important issues of the day.

But most of the time, on most stories, I don't think most reporters and editors are biased in the way that our most virulent critics suggest. We don't, consciously or subconsciously, slant our stories to fit our ideology.

Yes, I've read and heard all the complaints about most journalists voting for Al Gore over George W. Bush -- and for Bill Clinton over Bob Dole and for every other Democrat over every other Republican dating back at least to John Kennedy over Richard Nixon. This pattern supposedly proves that all reporters are liberals and their coverage is slanted to the Left.

I've also read and heard all the complaints about most major news organizations being owned by Republicans -- and, more recently, about all the major radio talk shows, plus Fox TV News, being dominated by conservatives, thus proving that the media are, in fact, slanted to the Right.

Sure, most reporters, like most other sentient beings, do have an ideology of sorts -- that is, we have personal opinions, often strong and, in our case, generally liberal. Only the uninformed or the inert have no opinions, and on issue after issue -- race relations, gun control, the environment, government spending, gay rights, capital punishment -- I think most journalists are more liberal than are most other Americans.

Yes, the people who own the conglomerates that own the television networks and many other major news organizations tend, like most other big businessmen, to be Republicans, as do the most successful talk-show hosts. And if Fox News is "fair and balanced," as its slogan boasts, it's certainly not intentional.

But to suggest that all this means, ipso facto, the media are politically biased in their news coverage is syllogistic reasoning at its worst. Talk radio hosts don't pretend to be impartial journalists. Fox is but one of many news outlets. In my experience, neither the conservative media moguls nor the liberal reporters try to impose their views on news stories.

Equally important, I honestly believe that most good reporters are able to set aside their personal political views when they cover a story.

Nevertheless, judging from what I read in my e-mail and hear on talk radio -- and looking at the success of Bernard Goldberg's book "Bias," which spent seven weeks atop the New York Times bestseller list early last year -- it's clear that allegations of ideological bias ring true with many Americans.

After all, they reason, if you feel strongly about a particular cause or a particular candidate, why wouldn't you use your journalistic platform to advance that cause or candidate? More to the point, how could you avoid doing so, at least subconsciously, no matter how committed you are to being fair? Wouldn't your personal feelings seep into the decisions, large and small, that you make as a journalist -- what stories to do, whom to interview, whom to quote, whom not to quote, what facts to emphasize, what language to use?

Sometimes -- rarely -- that does happen. Despite some evidence to the contrary, journalists are only human. And sometimes reporters bend so far backward trying to be fair that they wind up unfairly hurting the cause or candidate that many of them personally favor.

But I think the very real biases mentioned earlier -- the individual and institutional preference for change, conflict, bad news and sensationalism -- are far more common, and far more damaging, than any kind of intermittent, inadvertent ideological bias.

In the months and years before Sept. 11, most news organizations all but abandoned coverage of international news, and while Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and their terrorist colleagues have temporarily refocused much of the media attention on truly significant matters, even some of those matters (vide anthrax) have been covered in sensationalist style.

Equally bad, the "let's you and him fight" school of journalism, in which the slightest disagreement among public figures is blown up into bitter conflict, makes us look more like provocateurs than chroniclers. How many times will we read that Colin Powell is on his way out as secretary of state because he's losing the corridors-of-power battles with administration hard-liners? Wasn't it the summer of 2001 when we were reading that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was on his way out because he was losing a battle with Congress and military professionals over Bush's plan to overhaul the Pentagon?

An attitude that distorts

The news media's knee-jerk adversarial position toward those in power -- and our sneering assumption that virtually every politician is a liar or a hypocrite, invariably acting out of self-interest and self-aggrandizement, rather than out of a commitment to the public good -- has contributed to steadily declining voter turnout, discouraged many good men and women from seeking office, and makes us seem like cynical, self-righteous scandal-mongers.

Jim Lehrer of the Public Broadcasting Service has spoken of the "stench of contempt" that distorts much of our reportage -- and of the concomitant implication that only journalists are "smart enough to know what to do" about the various problems confronting society today.

Worst of all, the growing sensationalism-cum-trivialization of the news embodied in the media's sequential obsessions with O.J., Princess Di, Monica Lewinsky, Gary Condit, Martha Stewart, Elian Gonzales, shark attacks, the Indiana mother caught on tape apparently beating her 4-year-old daughter, and the frantic search for allegedly missing children (at a time when FBI statistics show that the kidnapping of children has actually declined) leaves us little time or space to cover the truly important issues of the day.

The media have made their daily news report much softer in recent years, and in the process, they've decided to devote much less time to politics and public affairs, says Thomas E. Patterson, who teaches at Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.

"Celebrity profiles, lifestyle scenes, hard-luck tales, good-luck tales and other human-interest stories rose from 11% to more than 20% of news coverage from 1980 to 1999," according to a Shorenstein Center study quoted in Patterson's new book, "The Vanishing Voter." "Stories about dramatic incidents -- crimes and disasters -- also doubled during this period. The number of news stories that contained elements of sensationalism jumped by 75%."

As "soft news" has taken up more space in newspaper news sections, "public-affairs coverage [has] dwindled," Patterson writes. "From 1980 to 2000, public-affairs stories decreased from 70% of news coverage to 50%."

So the way I see it, the problem with the media's political coverage isn't bias. It's shrinkage. And superficiality. I worry far more about the tarting up and dumbing down of our news media than I do about any ideological infiltration.

Dear Jeb,

     Thank you for taking a real interest in our ( Brooklyn Pizza) situation 
with workman's comp.  I feel blessed to have a governor who truly cares about 
all including the small businesses and not just the corporate giants.  I work 
with media and I want them to know that they can't spin what you do for the 
people of Florida.  

     We found a leasing company that was willing to take us.  We have to pay 
them now for payroll services as that was tied into their package.  It will 
be thousands more than what we were spending, but it won't be as high as the 
outrages rates we were looking at in the State pool.

     All this put us on edge, as we have noticed a dip in business since 
before Christmas.  Even a local attorney who eats at our restaurant asked for 
some coupons.  My husband spends most of his investment in buying quality 
products, so he does not have the margin to discount like Papa Johns or 
Dominos.  Our prices were already low for Fairbanks/Winter Park and for our 
436 and Perishing store near the Orlando Airport.  We have had to spend so 
much more in marketing and coupons that our profits are down.   

     We are still seriously planning to investigate selling if our overhead 
and insurance keeps rising.  It's sad.  We have 3 children to put through 
college.  Everyone loves my husband and his food.  Some drive over an hour to 
eat our pizza.  He's done it so long since 1984, I don't know what would be 
next.  Many of the distributors have told us they have been down too.

     If the insurance companies drive people out of business, then there is 
less taxes being made by the state and unemployment going out.  It's a pickle 
for sure.  We truly enjoyed meeting Kevin.  He is such a sharp guy.  I am 
sure he will be an asset to your administration. 

     I keep seeing your son being more involved in politics in the future.  
He will be well received and reach broader groups than expected.  I first 
started getting this when I saw him as a young boy on stage say "Viva La 
Bush" or something like that when your father was running for President.  I 
saw God's hand on him and that he will have great responsibilities.  It was 
amazing.

I do want to share one more thing.  We were in a Dillards in Altamonte 
Springs and we met a nice man from Turkey who waited on us that came to the 
U.S. through the lottery 5 years ago.  He is a chemist, wife is a pharmacist 
they have children.  He made a comment that got my attention.  He said he 
stopped going to the Mosque because the leader would not stop focusing on the 
president and the war.  He said he felt we should live peacefully with all, 
but this leader of the Mosque had a different spirit.  May want to have the 
this area checked out.

Enough of my chattering.  Blessings to your family.

Sincerely,
Andrea Boulden-Gagliano

Dear Gov. Bush,

I do hope you have a chance before Thursday (Jan. 23rd) to read the attached
letter voicing serious concerns about adoption of the University of Central
Florida Master Plan.  It seems that very little public input has been
allowed by the UCF public leadership on their plans---which, I think,
nonetheless will make use of public taxpayer dollars!
Ms. Eberle, whose letter I send you, has done a great deal of detailed
research over the past couple of years on the impacts of the UCF expansion,
and of some of the truly not "cricket" procedures they've used to bypass
serious review or dissent.
If you can, please please do read her letter before Thursday.  Her concerns
are those of quite a few people, mine included, as the Plan obliterates
large blocks of heretofore intended conservation acreage on the UCF land.
Thank you VERY much, Governor for your time and attention to this pressing

Jeb,
I've been corresponding with Dr. Richard Allington the past week and I 
thought you'd find the emails enlightening. As you'll see at the end of this 
email, I asked and received permission to share his emails. My assessment is 
he is not an opponent of your reading initiative, he just didn't win the 
competition with UCF and then overpriced his technology when they inquired as 
to its availability. His idea of funding a study of the UCF online program 
might be a worthwhile endeavor. I have not received any responses from the 
UCF team that Mary Laura Openshaw referred me to last week. They are expected 
to introduce their new online course for teachers to learn how to teach 
reading tomorrow. 
Did you play golf yesterday?
Peter   
   

Dr. Allington,
My name is Peter Johnson, I've left you a couple of voice mail messages on 
your office phone and have been in contact with Governor Bush about his 
Reading Initiative and the program being developed by Dr. Joe Torgesen at 
UCF. As a Gator alumnus I'm interested in learning what UF is doing to 
participate in this program and since you're the reading guru I've decided to 
go to you directly for the answers.
I've met with Bill Riffee some months ago and more recently with Jim Knight 
without much success. 
I have a very old friend in Atlanta who has developed a platform to deliver 
online courses effectively and his target market is K-12 teachers. See 
www.floridateacher.net
He needs more content and is looking for people interested in designing 
courses on his platform.
Let me know if you have any interest, in any case I'd like to learn the 
difference between your reading methods and those being promoted by the UCF 
group (if any).
Sincerely,
Peter Johnson

Peter
I'm in NYC working at Teachers College at the moment but will be back in my 
UF office on Friday. One problem we have yet to overcome at UF is 
intellectual property rights on distance learning courses. UF has no firm 
statement of faculty rights and so few faculty have been willing to develop 
on-line content until UF adopts a clear policy similar to that other 
universities have adopted that assigns those rights solely to faculty (as in 
my rights to my books). As far as UCF courses, I headed a team that developed 
a proposal for the on-line courses contract. We didn't get the award but UCF 
called us and wanted to use the on-line content we already inherited from the 
large-scale research project at Michigan State's Center for Improving Early 
Reading Achievement. I suggested that if UCF was willing to give us $1M of 
the funding they got we would cooperate. But no. Our content is video drawn 
from exemplary teacher classrooms that has been designed to teach teacher Ed 
candidates to actually "see" excellent instruction. It has been well 
researched and we use it in some of undergrad courses. Dr. Rick Ferdig, a new 
asst. prof from MSU is the better contact person for that content. As far as 
the UCF course content, they are handicapped in that they have no reading 
researchers on faculty and so rely on secondary reports of what the research 
says. Unfortunately many of the secondary reports, including the federal Put 
Reading First document have been shown to present a substantial distortion of 
what the national Reading Panel actually found and often offers 
"research-based" advice that contradicts the NRP and the larger existing 
database.

Dick Allington



Dick,
Thank you very much for your response. It is very enlightening. We should get 
together when you return to Gainesville. I'm interested in learning more 
about the various reading methods and might be able to facilitate a policy 
resolution at UF to get distance learning started. No promises, but I do know 
all the key players including some of the UF trustees. Take a look at your 
schedule and give me some options. I'm out of town next Wednesday through 
Friday. My cell phone is the best way to reach me, 352-219-3084, or this 
email address which I check frequently.
I sent an email to Catherine Emihovich this afternoon expressing my interest 
in developing an online reading course for teachers K-12. I realize the UCF 
process may be flawed but it has the support of the Jeb Bush administration, 
and I'm sure you would agree any effort to improve reading is better than no 
effort. Jeb introduced me (via email) to Mary Laura Openshaw who heads up his 
reading program and she directed me to Dr. Torgesen and UCF who I have not 
made contact with. The Governor's office called today to say they were 
sending me some information because I wanted to learn about the various 
reading teaching philosophies. Sounds like you're someone who could help me 
learn quickly.
Thanks again for the response,
Peter Johnson

Peter

I'm in WI on T-W so it looks like next week (27th) might be better time to 
try and talk. I'm not sure that I disagree very much Torgesen on reading 
research -- I do think phonological skills are overrated as problem though 
and that phonics is overrated as a solution but I think my pessimism is based 
in the research, including Joe's. I do think that one-size-fits-all mandates 
of the sort being offered under the Reading First initiative are also not 
supported by the research. And finally there is NO research that suggest that 
we can improve teaching through videos or on-line courses. This is an area 
I'd very much like to research however (and several colleagues would also 
jump at the chance to evaluate such efforts whether UCF's courses or other 
efforts).

Re the e-mail you received earlier on Werner Boyce Salt Springs State Park. That's one of the parks we saw this weekend. The most amazing thing about that bird count is that this park is surrounded on three sides by DENSE old, urban development. It really underscores the importance of urban greenspace.

Gov. Bush impresses with racial policy legal brief

If the U.S. Supreme Court bans race-based university admissions, the nation's anti-affirmative action movement could well owe a greater debt of gratitude to Florida Gov. Jeb Bush than to his brother, the president.

While President Bush won national acclaim from conservatives for his request last week that the court examine race preferences, it was the Florida governor -- far more than the president -- who dove headlong into the fight on behalf of their party's political base.

As scholars analyzed the legal briefs submitted late last week by the White House and the Florida governor's office in a case involving the University of Michigan, they quickly concluded that the president had side-stepped the most pressing questions related to the legality of race preferences while Gov. Bush made the only argument that could lead to their abolition.

''Jeb Bush's brief goes from page one to a conclusion, whereas the president's brief goes from page one to a blank sheet of paper,'' said Ed Blum, legal director for the American Civil Rights Institute, the group headed by Ward Connerly that ended affirmative action in California and tried to mount a similar campaign in Florida.

''The question before the court is, is diversity so important to the educational experience of a college student that a university can factor race into the equation when accepting or rejecting students?'' Blum said. ``The president's brief didn't answer that question.''

The governor's did.

''Racial diversity,'' his brief reads, ``is no more compelling a goal in the higher education context than in the context of other institutions or areas of state decision-making, including those upon which this Court has already ruled [negatively].''

Gov. Bush's brief goes on to call ''problematic'' the University of Michigan's assumption that racial diversity is equal to academic or ''viewpoint'' diversity.

That, legal scholars say, is the very question that will face the Supreme Court if the justices are to overturn a 1978 decision that set the standard for race-based preferences.

''Jeb's brief is respectful to the court in that it answers the question they care about,'' said Todd Gaziano, director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which lobbied the White House to make its brief more like Gov. Bush's.

Florida's so-called friend-of-the-court brief carries minuscule legal weight compared to the arguments offered on behalf of the White House by the U.S. solicitor general.

But, scholars agreed, it carries greater weight simply because it comes from the president's own brother, from a mega-state governor who was the first to roll back affirmative action in his state and from a man who is married to a Hispanic woman.

If the governor's brief does not influence the court -- and some thought it could at a minimum apply some pressure for a landmark ruling -- it will no doubt affect the public dialogue. And Jeb Bush, who won reelection overwhelmingly last year despite a first term tinged with racial tension, is obviously feeling far more free to air his views than a president who needs blacks and Hispanics to win reelection in 2004.

Perhaps it was that potential outcome that led the governor's lawyers to craft a defense of Jeb Bush's entire record on race that looks more like the text of a campaign speech than a legal missive.

Calling the Jeb Bush way the ''better way,'' the brief not only promotes the One Florida Initiative that rolled back affirmative action, but also links the governor's controversial education programs and his touchy-feely mentoring initiatives as a potential national alternative to race preferences.

It is perhaps Gov. Bush's first draft of what he thinks his political epitaph ought to someday read. He may never run for president, but this may be his way of taking his agenda to the national political stage.

And it helps erase a rocky political record on race that dates back to the governor's 1994 campaign for governor when Bush said he would do ''probably nothing'' for blacks. The record has stretched through the marches and protests over One Florida, and the contested 2000 presidential election in which many black voters blamed him for a failed voting system.

''Florida's plan is better,'' reads his brief, ``in that it no longer accepts the lack of quality in the public schools that serve our underprivileged children; better because it recognizes the need to provide mentoring, tutoring, and other extra attention to those underprivileged children and their teachers; better because it encourages all students regardless of race or economic status to aspire to post-secondary education; better because it no longer accepts a separate standard on the basis of race; better because it focuses on providing all races with the opportunity to meet common standards, and finally, better because it looks forward to a day when racial classifications and separate standards are no longer deemed necessary by anyone.''

This is, to be sure, one man's view of himself.

Many black leaders in Florida question the Bush record on race. Bush argues correctly that the number of minorities entering college has remained stable or even slightly increased under One Florida, but some black leaders argue that the success has not necessarily translated to the flagship schools and premier academic programs.

State Sen. Les Miller, a Tampa Democrat who heads the Legislature's black caucus, accused Bush of living ''in a vacuum'' when it comes to race, reminding us that it was the One Florida program that sparked one of the biggest civil rights protests in state history and prompted a sit-in by black legislators.

''Jeb Bush should not be inserting himself in an issue that has nothing to with the state of Florida,'' Miller said. ``At a time when the Republican Party talks about healing relations with African Americans, an action like this unnecessarily serves to divide our state and our nation.''

But Miller may be missing the point. If Jeb Bush can make a case that One Florida, coupled with his education policies and his focus on reading and mentoring, actually accomplishes more than generations of race preferences and affirmative action, he could turn the partisan debate over race on its head. At a minimum, he gets the conversation going while his brother avoids the treacherousness of killing affirmative action just as he builds an ethnic coalition to assure reelection.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
    This little girl is our daughter, Savannah Leigh Mathews.  She is a client of Developmental Services, and has been since September 2, 1999.  In her short seven years of life, she has worked harder and faced more challenges than most adults.  Because of her strong will, our perservence, and the help of many professionals and volunteers, Savannah is a walking miracle, literally.  She has endured numerous surgeries, ranging from eye and ear procedures all the way to open heart surgery.  She has spent more than her share of hours in hospital rooms, and has endured countless hours of physical, occupational, and speech therapies.  She progressed from ambulating in a wheelchair to using a walker.  In February of 2002, her ENT, Dr. James Atkins, performed a surgery that enabled her to walk independently.  At 6 1/2 years old, our daughter began walking by herself!  It was through subsequent hours of physical therapy that she was able to gain true independence.  Then our insurance coverage expired.  Her physical therapist volunteered her time with Savannah for 5 months while we awaited her turn to receive Med-waiver services.  She finally had to move on to other patients.  We are still waiting.
 
     Our daughter does not speak, but we recently discovered, through a speaker at World Congress, that she has a physical condition that may be corrected.  Through surgery and intensive speech therapy, Savannah will have the chance to voice her thoughts, feelings, and opinions.  We want nothing less than for our daughter to walk AND talk, and we intend to use every avenue and resource possible to make this happen.    
 
     Governor Bush, we listened as you spoke to us at Orlando's World Congress on Disabilities and told the story of a young lady whose life was dramatically changed through the help that med-waiver services provided her.  We listened as the audience applauded your statement that all the people on the original waiting list for med-waiver are being serviced.  We, however, sat with tears in our eyes.
 
     We need answers that developmental services personnel in central Florida, as well as those in Tallahassee, will not provide.  When will Savannah receive her med-waiver services?  Where is she on "the list?"  We are told that she will receive services when she "shows up on the computer."  Governor Bush, that's not good enough.  There has to be some accountability as to Savannah's place in the system.  She is not a case to us.  She is a beautiful daughter, sister, granddaughter, dancer, Daisy girl scout, friend, and inspiration to those meet her.  Please help us find the answer to exactly where Savannah stands on the med-waiver waiting list, and when she will begin receiving the services that we've awaited two years so far.  Someone has answers to our questions.  We are entitled to, and she deserves, these answers.
 
                                                                              Respectfully,
                                                                              Kevin and Sheri Mathews

Dear Gov. Jeb,

1) Good Republican Carla Wright (who you appointed to the School Board and
has since been elected to the board) will be in Tallahassee for several
days starting tomorrow, and hopes to get to see you briefly.  She's also on
the Historic board and is seeking your help in locating an architectural
review document regarding the controversial downtown parking gargage issue
here.  Evidently said document has mysteriously disappeared on the State
level.  I'm letting you know because it's a holiday and so I don't expect
to reach any of your staff.  So this is a 'head's up."

2) A lot of people here were surprised and relieved to read in the St.
Augustine Record the statement by your spokesperson, Alia Faraj, that you
want to protect the Guana Wildlife Management Area, and how you feel about
conserving our natural resources. They're beginning to listen to me about
you around here, thanks to you (and to that impressive visit to the Guana
Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Reserch Reserve (GTNNERR) office by
Lt. Gov. Brogan, with me during the campaign). (We will all hate to lose
him if he moves on).  We also hope for and anticipate a visit to the NERR
by you one day, and plan to arrange a boat trip from one end of the reserve
to the other (From the Guana area where the education center will be to the
Mantanzas Inlet/Marineland area where the Research facility is). 

3) We all cheered you and the President after reading the article in
today's St. Augustine Record about your mutual attitudes on affirmative
action and finding other, better ways to achieve the same goals.  I
strongly believe that to use reverse discrimination as a way to end
discrimination is self-defeating, and that your ideas are the best possible
at this moment in history.  The article speaks of Florida being a
laboratory for testing new ideas; I always said you would make a model for
the rest of the country with this state.  I'm particularly pleased to see
it in print.   ---- 	Susan ----   PS - I'm doing better, thank you.  Also,
I understand that my Grandson, Christopher Adkins (the amazing genius),
will probably be playing at the Mansion for another reception on Feb. 6.
(Just a reminder that he belongs to us.)

January 20, 2003
 
Dear Friends,
 
      Something unusual happened one morning this past week in my classroom.  Even though this was an unusual event in MY LIFE--I know similar scenarios have been played out MANY thousands of times in recent weeks and all  throughout America's history as our country continually fights for our FREEDOMS.   So I would like to share this event with you, in HONOR of our brave, dedicated SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN and their SACRIFICIAL FAMILIES:  
 
       On January 3, a picture of Pfc. Jeric Heflin, 19, the brother of my 6th Grade student, Melody Heflin, was featured on the front page of The Lakeland Ledger (see his picture below).  
 
       After I got over the shock of just how YOUNG this young man looks and is, I asked my vivacious Melody to have her brother come to our World Geography and History classes so we could encourage him and let him know how PROUD we are of him as he was to soon leave for duty in the Middle East conflict.
 
       A few days later, I asked Melody about when Jeric was going to come visit us because he only had 10 days before he was to be deployed.  She shook her head "No" and after questioning her, she stated, "He's just too SHY to come see us, Ms. Bryan."  I assured her that that was O.K., but asked her to tell him that if he didn't care, my classes would like to "adopt" him as their "BIG BROTHER" and send him cards, letters and candy--things to let him know WE CARE about his sacrifices so we Americans can be FREE here each day! 
 
      She broke out in a big, sunny grin and said, "He'll like that Ms. Bryan, I'll tell him."
 
      The days quickly flew by--as they tend to do and last Thursday morning's Planning Period was unusually hectic for me.  There just wasn't enough time to do all that was necessary before my next class arrived:  getting the day's FCAT practice tests ready, putting all the assignments and that day's Motivational Moment on the board, writing next week's lesson plans, and catching up on our school's internal email messages.  
 
       As I hurried to complete the most vital tasks, my door suddenly opened and the very competent teacher next door quickly asked, "Ms. Bryan, can Melody please come in here with you?  She's totally broken down, her brother was shipped out today!  I'm in the middle of a Reading assignment that we must finish before the period is over and Melody needs some special attention." 
 
      Dear God, I said in my mind, HOW DO I COMFORT this usually coquettish child who has probably never faced any SEPARATION from this very CHERISED, older brother, much less this type of separation??  And what about the things I MUST DO before my students arrive??
 
      Melody, whose streaked and redden face told me that she had been crying profusely, quickly ran into my arms as I told my comrade next door, "I'll keep her--it is all right!"  
 
      Relieved that she could now get her other students settled and back on task, my neighbor closed our connecting door and returned to direct her antsy charges.
 
      Now, in silence--Melody and I just stood--rocking  back and forth with our arms wrapped around each other.  I stroked her hair and tried--desperately--to remember what I'd learned about handling LOSS and GRIEF!  Just what do you say to console an 11 year old about her 19 year old brother leaving to go off--possibly to a war half-way around the world--when no one can say WHEN he'll return or even IF he'll be coming back??  
 
       The only thing that my mind could grab on to say, was "I am so SORRY!"  
 
       Knowing from my own experiences in dealing with grief how trite "I know how you feel" sounds in times of anguish, I instinctively knew not to voice that.  But, WHAT do you say?  We stood, slightly rocking back and forth for a long time, with Melody's face buried into my sweater.  When she got quiet, I gently put her at arm's length and looked into her young, tear-stained, swollen face and said, "Honey, do you want to talk about it?"  Her shook her head vehemently--and said a determined "NO!", so I just pulled her back to me and held her some more.
 
      "Now what am I do?" my mind questioned.  The clock on our back wall told me that the bell would ring soon--but this child is hurting!  WHAT in the world can I say that will make a difference in this?  Just what is my responsibility?  How to I get some of my tasks done? 
 
     Finally, I remember that Melody likes to draw, even MORE than most kids.  I quietly said, "Melody, did you get to say EVERYTHING that you wanted to say to your brother before he left?"
 
     "No Ma'am," she haltingly responded.  
 
     "Well, how do you feel about drawing him a card and put some of those things on it that you didn't have time to tell him?"
 
     "My mother only has an address where he'll be at for today, after that we don't know." she answered pitifully.
 
    "Well, Honey, as soon as they get him to base, he'll be allowed to call home and then if you have your card ready you can mail it to him.  Do you think that might work?"
 
     She shook her head saying O.K. and I hurried got her paper as she when to procure our classroom basket of markers.  She set to work at a table near me, as I prayed this redirection tactic would as least temporarily ease some of her pain.
 
    Within just a moment or two, she had four beautiful red hearts drawn diagonally in each corner of her "card" and was beginning another one in the top center of the page.  Every few minutes, as we worked, I asked how she was coming along. 
 
    "Hum, O.K." was her response each time. The bell rang--and my 7th Grade class came pouring in.  To be honest I only got a flash of Melody's almost finished card to her brother.  But, somehow this experience has touched me--made me MORE aware of THE COST OF FREEDOM than any other experience in my life!
 
    My hat is definitely off to all the Jeric's and Melody's and the myriads of families that they represent, as America--once again, faces an uncertain future with yet another war looming on our horizon.  But, without their sacrifice we would NOT be privileged to live in our precious HOME of the FREE and LAND of the BRAVE.
 
May GOD continue to BLESS AMERICA and especially our Military personnel and their families!
 
Sincerely,
 
Ms. Ellen Irene Bryan, Patriot and Teacher
 
 Turn up your sound--sit back and reflect on our freedoms and how they are PRESERVED for us EACH DAY!

you make me cry. Maybe it is the long day. But I think it is your passion which I share. Let us make this work! 
 
Here is what I believe. We are all divinely inspired as God's creatures.. Those with developmental disabilities are divinely inspired as well,  but have an added protection and closeness with God. I have not consulted with divinity professors on this. I have not asked my priest. I just plain believe it. I just know that our Lord would protect them above all others. 
 
So, acting on that belief, it is our obligation to make sure that they receive our support in His honor and in recognition of their dignity. 
 
That is easier said than done. Their families are fiercely loyal and many times frustrated. They are angry after a near generation of hurt and betrayal. I have tried to rectify this with doubling of the funding in four years but have been betrayed myself by a beacuracry that is insensitive and incompetent. 
 
Now you step in. Shelly, my hope is that you clean up the mess and shoot straight with our constituents. 
Tell them the truth and I will go to bat for you to the bitter end. No more empty promises. Only the truth and hope will prevail. I know that Secretary Regier will support you and so will I! 
 
 
Thank you for agreeing to serve.. 
 

Jeb Bush

I have always known deep in my heart and soul that I would devote my life to serving individuals with disabilities. What I never expected was to have Florida's most powerful Governor, who could choose any cause or issue, to make individuals with developmental disabilities one of his top priorities and then ask me to assume a leadership role. I am so humbled and grateful for this opportunity to serve the most courageous and inspirational individuals and families I have ever known. I plan to give this job my very best.

 

Very sincerely,

Shelly

Shelly, you are a breath of fresh air. Yes, I would like you to respond directly. I am so grateful you are stepping up to the plate and willing to go to the front lines. I am so confident that our families will know what they will get, no false promises from here on out..
 
Thank you.

Governor,
 
I realize this explanation may not bring comfort or change this family's desperate circumstances, but the original Developmental Disabilities spending plan provided services to individuals who became eligible for the Waiver prior to July 1, 1999 (these are individuals on the original waiting list who have all been served thanks to your leadership and support from the legislature); or individuals who are in a crisis situation.  Persons determined to be eligible after July 1, 1999 have been being placed on the waiting list. According to the information provided in the e-mail below, Savannah was not placed on the waiting list until September 1999. The order in which individuals will be served from the waiting list is based on the date the individual became a client of Developmental Disabilities. Savannah should be high on the waiting list, but I will need to confirm her placement with the DD program. 

 

The family also mentions that they have lost their insurance. If their income is below 200% of the poverty level, they may be eligible for Medicaid Title 21 coverage through our Kidcare program or HealthyKids. If their income is above 200% of the federal poverty level, they would not be eligible for Title 21 and may be seeking enrollment in the DS waiver to become eligible through a special waiver income category which allows a child to qualify  as "a family of one." This is a special provision under the waiver program which allows Medicaid to discount the parental income when determining the child's financial eligibility for the program. We have approximately 2000 children currently enrolled in the DS waiver program who fall in this category.  I'm sure you probably already know this, but  your friend, Lucy was one of the first children to quality under this special provision. 

 

Obviously, the current budget deficit presents a serious challenge to original plans to begin serving 1,542 individuals on the waiting list with funds allocated by the 2002 legislature. The original DD program spending plan would have begun to phase in these individuals over the next 6 months. I am hopeful, but still uncertain as to whether or not the department can begin serving individuals on the waiting list since July  1, 1999 (other than those deemed in "crisis status.")  Regardless, Savannah should be among the first new people to be served given her application date. I would also be interested to know whether or not the child has been considered for "crisis status" given the recent loss of insurance. I plan to look into this as well as her current status on the waiting list to provide you and the family a more definitive answer. 

 

Please let me know if you would like for me to draft a response on your behalf or contact this family directly to try to offer an explanation and whatever support we can offer.

 

Shelly

Dear Governor Bush,
 
    This little girl is our daughter, Savannah Leigh Mathews.  She is a client of Developmental Services, and has been since September 2, 1999.  In her short seven years of life, she has worked harder and faced more challenges than most adults.  Because of her strong will, our perservence, and the help of many professionals and volunteers, Savannah is a walking miracle, literally.  She has endured numerous surgeries, ranging from eye and ear procedures all the way to open heart surgery.  She has spent more than her share of hours in hospital rooms, and has endured countless hours of physical, occupational, and speech therapies.  She progressed from ambulating in a wheelchair to using a walker.  In February of 2002, her ENT, Dr. James Atkins, performed a surgery that enabled her to walk independently.  At 6 1/2 years old, our daughter began walking by herself!  It was through subsequent hours of physical therapy that she was able to gain true independence.  Then our insurance coverage expired.  Her physical therapist volunteered her time with Savannah for 5 months while we awaited her turn to receive Med-waiver services.  She finally had to move on to other patients.  We are still waiting.
 
     Our daughter does not speak, but we recently discovered, through a speaker at World Congress, that she has a physical condition that may be corrected.  Through surgery and intensive speech therapy, Savannah will have the chance to voice her thoughts, feelings, and opinions.  We want nothing less than for our daughter to walk AND talk, and we intend to use every avenue and resource possible to make this happen.    
 
     Governor Bush, we listened as you spoke to us at Orlando's World Congress on Disabilities and told the story of a young lady whose life was dramatically changed through the help that med-waiver services provided her.  We listened as the audience applauded your statement that all the people on the original waiting list for med-waiver are being serviced.  We, however, sat with tears in our eyes.
 
     We need answers that developmental services personnel in central Florida, as well as those in Tallahassee, will not provide.  When will Savannah receive her med-waiver services?  Where is she on "the list?"  We are told that she will receive services when she "shows up on the computer."  Governor Bush, that's not good enough.  There has to be some accountability as to Savannah's place in the system.  She is not a case to us.  She is a beautiful daughter, sister, granddaughter, dancer, Daisy girl scout, friend, and inspiration to those meet her.  Please help us find the answer to exactly where Savannah stands on the med-waiver waiting list, and when she will begin receiving the services that we've awaited two years so far.  Someone has answers to our questions.  We are entitled to, and she deserves, these answers.
 
                                                                              Respectfully,
                                                                              Kevin and Sheri Mathews

January 20, 2003
 
Dear Friends,
 
      Something unusual happened one morning this past week in my classroom.  Even though this was an unusual event in MY LIFE--I know similar scenarios have been played out MANY thousands of times in recent weeks and all  throughout America's history as our country continually fights for our FREEDOMS.   So I would like to share this event with you, in HONOR of our brave, dedicated SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN and their SACRIFICIAL FAMILIES:  
 
       On January 3, a picture of Pfc. Jeric Heflin, 19, the brother of my 6th Grade student, Melody Heflin, was featured on the front page of The Lakeland Ledger (see his picture below).  
 
       After I got over the shock of just how YOUNG this young man looks and is, I asked my vivacious Melody to have her brother come to our World Geography and History classes so we could encourage him and let him know how PROUD we are of him as he was to soon leave for duty in the Middle East conflict.
 
       A few days later, I asked Melody about when Jeric was going to come visit us because he only had 10 days before he was to be deployed.  She shook her head "No" and after questioning her, she stated, "He's just too SHY to come see us, Ms. Bryan."  I assured her that that was O.K., but asked her to tell him that if he didn't care, my classes would like to "adopt" him as their "BIG BROTHER" and send him cards, letters and candy--things to let him know WE CARE about his sacrifices so we Americans can be FREE here each day! 
 
      She broke out in a big, sunny grin and said, "He'll like that Ms. Bryan, I'll tell him."
 
      The days quickly flew by--as they tend to do and last Thursday morning's Planning Period was unusually hectic for me.  There just wasn't enough time to do all that was necessary before my next class arrived:  getting the day's FCAT practice tests ready, putting all the assignments and that day's Motivational Moment on the board, writing next week's lesson plans, and catching up on our school's internal email messages.  
 
       As I hurried to complete the most vital tasks, my door suddenly opened and the very competent teacher next door quickly asked, "Ms. Bryan, can Melody please come in here with you?  She's totally broken down, her brother was shipped out today!  I'm in the middle of a Reading assignment that we must finish before the period is over and Melody needs some special attention." 
 
      Dear God, I said in my mind, HOW DO I COMFORT this usually coquettish child who has probably never faced any SEPARATION from this very CHERISED, older brother, much less this type of separation??  And what about the things I MUST DO before my students arrive??
 
      Melody, whose streaked and redden face told me that she had been crying profusely, quickly ran into my arms as I told my comrade next door, "I'll keep her--it is all right!"  
 
      Relieved that she could now get her other students settled and back on task, my neighbor closed our connecting door and returned to direct her antsy charges.
 
      Now, in silence--Melody and I just stood--rocking  back and forth with our arms wrapped around each other.  I stroked her hair and tried--desperately--to remember what I'd learned about handling LOSS and GRIEF!  Just what do you say to console an 11 year old about her 19 year old brother leaving to go off--possibly to a war half-way around the world--when no one can say WHEN he'll return or even IF he'll be coming back??  
 
       The only thing that my mind could grab on to say, was "I am so SORRY!"  
 
       Knowing from my own experiences in dealing with grief how trite "I know how you feel" sounds in times of anguish, I instinctively knew not to voice that.  But, WHAT do you say?  We stood, slightly rocking back and forth for a long time, with Melody's face buried into my sweater.  When she got quiet, I gently put her at arm's length and looked into her young, tear-stained, swollen face and said, "Honey, do you want to talk about it?"  Her shook her head vehemently--and said a determined "NO!", so I just pulled her back to me and held her some more.
 
      "Now what am I do?" my mind questioned.  The clock on our back wall told me that the bell would ring soon--but this child is hurting!  WHAT in the world can I say that will make a difference in this?  Just what is my responsibility?  How to I get some of my tasks done? 
 
     Finally, I remember that Melody likes to draw, even MORE than most kids.  I quietly said, "Melody, did you get to say EVERYTHING that you wanted to say to your brother before he left?"
 
     "No Ma'am," she haltingly responded.  
 
     "Well, how do you feel about drawing him a card and put some of those things on it that you didn't have time to tell him?"
 
     "My mother only has an address where he'll be at for today, after that we don't know." she answered pitifully.
 
    "Well, Honey, as soon as they get him to base, he'll be allowed to call home and then if you have your card ready you can mail it to him.  Do you think that might work?"
 
     She shook her head saying O.K. and I hurried got her paper as she when to procure our classroom basket of markers.  She set to work at a table near me, as I prayed this redirection tactic would as least temporarily ease some of her pain.
 
    Within just a moment or two, she had four beautiful red hearts drawn diagonally in each corner of her "card" and was beginning another one in the top center of the page.  Every few minutes, as we worked, I asked how she was coming along. 
 
    "Hum, O.K." was her response each time. The bell rang--and my 7th Grade class came pouring in.  To be honest I only got a flash of Melody's almost finished card to her brother.  But, somehow this experience has touched me--made me MORE aware of THE COST OF FREEDOM than any other experience in my life!
 
    My hat is definitely off to all the Jeric's and Melody's and the myriads of families that they represent, as America--once again, faces an uncertain future with yet another war looming on our horizon.  But, without their sacrifice we would NOT be privileged to live in our precious HOME of the FREE and LAND of the BRAVE.
 
May GOD continue to BLESS AMERICA and especially our Military personnel and their families!
 
Sincerely,
 
Ms. Ellen Irene Bryan, Patriot and Teacher
 
 Turn up your sound--sit back and reflect on our freedoms and how they are PRESERVED for us EACH DAY!
 
We are SO BLESSED by the SACRIFICES of many!
 
MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS AMERICA--especially our Military!!!!
Ellen

But, without their sacrifice we would NOT be privileged to live in our precious HOME of the FREE and LAND of the BRAVE.
 
May GOD continue to BLESS AMERICA and especially our Military personnel and their families!
 
Sincerely,
 
Ms. Ellen Irene Bryan, Patriot and Teacher
 
 Turn up your sound--sit back and reflect on our freedoms and how they are PRESERVED for us EACH DAY!
 
We are SO BLESSED by the SACRIFICES of many!
 
MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS AMERICA--especially our Military!!!!

SPECIAL TO THE BEACON
LAKE HELEN - When folks in this town talk about Jimmy Martin, you get a sense of a common man with uncommon values and ethics.   His love for and dedication to his family are mentioned in every conversation.
Jimmy and his companion of 12 years, Ginger Barbour, are the parents of two 
beautiful little boys. Devin is 4, and Logan is just 9 months old.  Before his death Nov. 20, Jimmy was frequently seen on his farm with both boys in tow, or riding bicycles in his neighborhood with the boys.
At his memorial service, those who knew Jimmy best spoke.  Dale Shipman asked people to look around the church and notice the ethnic groups represented.
"Jimmy brought us all together without leaving the farm," Shipman said.

People say Jimmy treated everyone with respect. Agustin and Rojelio Muñoz worked for Jimmy for 13 years at his fernery. But he always told them he was not the boss. 

The well-known Lake Helen farmer wasn't a white-collar kind of guy. He was proud of being a farmer, and he worked alongside Agustin and Rojelio. The people who worked for Directions-

The Honorable Jeb Bush:
 
My heartiest congratulations on your historical re-investiture as our Governor.  Our state is quite fortunate to say the least to have as its Governor for another four years a person of your caliber and leadership as Florida faces many challenges.  Insurance is one of those challenge areas.  This is the reason for this contact with you.
 
As you continue the task of making permanent appointments of qualified people to serve your current administration, It is my strong hope that you consider making Kevin M. McCarty's appointment as the Director of the Office of Insurance Regulation permanent. Our State and your administration will benefit tremendously from Kevin's integrity, ability and professional background to oversee this reorganized department.   He has a proven track record every step of the way to his current position through numerous administrations.  In any given circumstance Kevin weighs the facts insightfully and fairly and makes even-handed decisions based on those facts.  His experience makes him uniquely qualified to do this job.  He knows Florida, its critical insurance issues, and how to rectify them in a manner that will do you and our state proud.  
 
I have known Kevin personally and professionally for some 8 years.  I am familiar with many aspects of the the insurance arena or industry. I am concerned about our state's escalating insurance crisis and the potential damage it could cause.  It is very important that we have somebody in this position that knows Florida's critical insurance issues, the challenges ahead, and whom can do the job you want done to address those issues properly now while you are in Office.  We need that job done now.  Kevin is the person that can do that job now.  
 
This is why I am recommending that you make Kevin's temporary appointment permanent.  Should you deem it necessary, I would be happy to provide further information or discuss this with you or your Director of Appointments.  At any rate, I appreciate your consideration of my submission.  I remain,
 
Very truly yours,

Importance: High


Honorable Governor:
 
This past Sunday morning, a cold morning in our State, I read with detail and dismay the news in the Miami Herald about the potential dissapearance of the 'Medically Needy' program in our State. I could not believe and/or understand that such a "needy social program" may be affected by cuts in our State budget.
 
I thought of my sister Mayra D. Gutierrez, who did not choose to have a mental disability, .....................but she does.
I thought of other mental patients like my sister Mayra, and I wondered, what would become of these individuals? ..........
How would they survive? What can they do?
 
My sister Mayra receives disability benefits in the amount of approximately $690/month while her medicine expenses exceeds $1100/month. What is she supposed to do if the program is terminated?  She, and others like her, can not function in our society without their 'needy' medicine.  
 
What does the future hold for my sister Mayra? and others like her?
 
She could become a homeless.........How much would that cost the State and/or other local agencies or;
She could be committed to a mental institution like the new South Florida State Hospital......How much would that cost the State? or
She could become a criminal or comit a crime and be placed in a cell away from society. How much would that cost the State?
 
It is interesting to note that my sister, in her younger years, worked for the State, for 91/2 years. Unfortunatelly for her, she became mentally ill and was asked to resign before she could reach the '10 year mark', thus losing her aspiration for retirement benefits.
 
I ask you to do everything in your power as Governor of this State to find a solution for the continuity of the Medically Needy program.
I truly understand your responsibility to balance the budget, however, there may be other programs that may be reduced.... programs that may not have such a dramatic impact in the lives of our 'mental patients'. They, as individuals, deserve a right to be part of our society!
 
I thank you in advance for your consideration to my request!
 
Respectfully, 
 
Mario H. Gutierrez

ST PATRICK SCHOOL 8TH GRADER, SAMANTHA WELLS, ORGANIZES 2ND ANNUAL ST. PAT'S KIDS CARE WITH BEARS FOR SHERIFF'S TRAUMA BEAR PROGRAM

(South Tampa - January 21, 2003) - Samantha Wells, a St. Patrick School 8th Grader, was moved by the words of President Bush after the September 11 attacks when he asked American children to step up and help Afghan children. She dutifully sent her dollars for the Afghan Children's Relief Fund. Then she found out about the Sheriff Department's Trauma Bear Program where deputies provide distressed children with a stuffed bear. 

Samantha brought an idea to student council, for St. Patrick Students to have a Teddy Bear Drive for the Sheriff's program. The idea was embraced by everyone and she put together the first St. Pat's Kids Care with Bears Drive that ask students and the local community to donate a Teddy Bears. Last year she collected over 280 bears. 

Last week she began the 2d Annual St. Pat's Kids Care With Bear Drive. At a special Mass on January 29 at St. Patrick Church, she will again present to a Sheriff Department representative all the bears collected from the students at the school. 

When asked why she took on such a challenge, the fourteen year old responds that she wanted to do something while serving on Student Council that would help her community and other children. St. Patrick's students and community have responded with cute little Teddy Bears arriving at the School daily. Her goal is 300 bears. 

Samantha is the daughter of Gene and Linda Wells, who have encouraged her and are very proud of their young daughter's commitment and accomplishments. "She is a remarkable young woman who thinks of children that a less fortunate than her," says her beaming mother, Linda Wells. Samantha intends to continue the program next year at Robinson High School, where she will be starting as a freshman and also return to help with St. Patrick annual program she started.

Bears can also be brought to St. Patrick Catholic School's Office at 4518 S. Manhattan Ave., Tampa, FL 33611 (813) 839-5056, Monday through Friday. 8:30 a.m. - 2 p.m. For additional information please contact Linda Wells, (813) 232-2672 Ext. 103, Cell (813) 453-8292 or email:  <mailto:Lindawells@copaparts.com> Lindawells@copaparts.com OR Joe Molloy, School Principal, (813) 839-5056.

Letters to the Editors

Lawmakers must be good stewards of all public funds


(c) St. Petersburg Times
published January 21, 2003 

As a member of the Legislative Budget Commission, I want to respond to some of the opinions expressed in the articles and editorial (Tallahassee's fanatics, Jan. 17) written by the St. Petersburg Times regarding federal tax dollars being rejected by the commission 

First, let me clarify that the state of Florida has not lost any federal funds. However, I believe it is my duty to scrutinize budget expenditures to ensure that all money, both state and federal, is being spent in a responsible manner. Remember, federal dollars are Floridians' hard-earned tax money, too. 

Approval of an underground storage tank cleanup, a public awareness campaign for cardiovascular disease, and funding for the Department of Environmental Protection was simply delayed until we receive further detailed information from the respective agencies. Without question, it is my full intent to maximize the amount of federal dollars coming into our state. It is also my duty to the citizens of this state to be a good steward of the people's money. 

The Legislative Budget Commission will reconvene in February, and I firmly believe that we will have the additional information needed to approve these expenditures.
-- Gus M. Bilirakis, representative, Florida House District 48, Tarpon Springs 

Proud to be a "Tallahassee fanatic'

Re: Florida lawmakers snub free money, Jan. 16 and Tallahassee's fanatics, editorial, Jan. 17. 

As a member of the Legislative Budget Commission, I am writing to set the record straight and correct the misrepresentations and arrogant tone of, to use your word, the "grotesque" editorial referenced above. 

In brief, the Legislative Budget Commission reviews state agency requests for funding changes "off-budget," which means when Legislators are not in session. 

Several points are important: 

1. There is no such thing as "free money" as your misleading headline reflected last week. It is hard-earned taxpayer money that we are considering, not money from Santa or the Tooth Fairy. 

2. It is not cardiovascular disease education, child nutrition programs or oil spill cleanup issues that were being questioned. It is the process by which these funds are appropriated that was questioned. 

3. Federal money (taxpayer money) was not given up, was not lost. Conservatives do recognize the value of getting Florida taxpayer money back from Washington. 

4. A Legislator does not need past experience on an appropriation committee to be able to assess proper fund transfers and adjustments to prior budget expenditures. 

5. During the February meeting of the Legislative Budget Commission, the requests that were voted down will be reconsidered, and I fully expect to be able to vote for them. 

6. As for this House seat being better left empty, incorrect again. It would be far worse if an "empty suit" were occupying it. 

Thank you for referring to me (and my colleagues) as "Tallahassee fanatics." The citizens I represent (especially single-parent families and seniors on fixed incomes) expect no less intensity and vigilance when government spends their money.
-- Leslie Waters, representative, Florida House District 51, St. Petersburg 

An outrageous snub

Re: Florida lawmakers snub free money, Jan. 16. 

Outraged. That's all I could feel when reading the article about the Legislature, in particular the House, not drawing down federal dollars to help our health care system. First we had state Rep. Frank Farkas, who was leading the charge to do away with mammograms, and now we have state Rep. Leslie Waters voting against dollars (being given to us with no strings attached from the federal government) that would fund a public awareness campaign to lower risks of heart disease, stroke and breast cancer in women. What are these legislators thinking? 

One more outrage -- and that is for the Times putting this important article on the bottom of the front page so Harry Potter could be at the top of the page. I only care about Harry Potter if some of his wizards would perform magic on the Legislature to make them act more responsibly.
-- Scott Huffman, St. Petersburg 

Snub needs reconsidering

Re: Florida lawmakers snub free money. 

Our state lawmakers showed us once again that they waved goodbye to logic a long time ago by turning down no-strings-attached federal money. Why not let our state receive millions in funds for breast cancer awareness, feeding the poor and cleaning up oil spills? The House member who expressed concern about being labeled a "rubber stamp" should be more concerned about acting "dumb as a stump." Hopefully, the Legislative Budget Commission will reconsider its decision next month and support Gov. Bush's call to take advantage of these beneficial grants.
-- Dan Krassner, Largo
NOTE: Krassner ran against Leslie Waters last year in the Republican primary for the District 51 House seat. 

Future is dim for Florida women

Re: Florida lawmakers snub free money. 

If this is any indication of what the future holds for women in the state of Florida, we had better all move out. Our state Legislature had an opportunity to gain $1-million for the state Department of Health. All the lawmakers had to do was vote to allow the transfer of $59,000 to the Department of Health and the federal government would have sent the state of Florida $1-million to create a media awareness campaign and data collection on heart disease, diabetes, stroke and other health issues in women. The State Budget Commission voted to kill it -- and our very own representative, Gus Bilirakis, voted to kill it. I live in his district, and I would like to know why he would vote down something that would help all of the women in his district? So did Leslie Waters in St. Petersburg. Is this the way they are going to treat women? If so, we (the women) need to defeat them the next time they run for office.
-- Margaret Hyde, public policy chair, Clearwater Branch, American Association of University Women, Clearwater 

House members keep it clean

Re: Florida lawmakers snub free money. 

Let's see if I understand the issue. House members of a joint budget committee reject acceptance of federal dollars because, in their opinion, state agencies "did not have a sound plan to spend the money." Senate members "harshly criticized the decision as irresponsible" because no state money was required. Apparently the senators consider this money "free." Where does it come from? Why, it comes from taxpayers all over the United States. How is it that free? 

It appears to me that spending any tax money without a clear plan of benefit is the equivalent of "pork barrel." Who are providers of pork? I believe we call them "hogs." Who are the heroes in this porcine battle? Why, the House members, "many of them newcomers to budget committees." May these courageous new members, during their terms of service, keep their feet clean by avoiding pig pens.
-- John Christy Clement, Tierra Verde 

A hopeful solution to budget crisis

How can the state budget crisis be solved? Here is one suggestion. 

About 80 percent of persons in state prison are confined for offenses involving drugs or alcohol. When a judge sends a person to prison for a drug or alcohol offense, it costs the taxpayers at least $20,000 per year. If most of these persons were given a choice of addiction therapy, or prison, it would be significantly less costly, and much more effective. 

I am glad our governor's daughter is getting therapy for her addiction. That is "restorative justice." The courts should be giving that same option to many others who are in lockup. 

Prison is appropriate, if a murder or other serious crime is committed by a person under the influence. The vast majority of cases are not that serious. Far too many people are being sent to prison. However, when they are released, recidivism records show about two-thirds will be arrested again within three years. "Lockup" does not solve the problem, and the taxpayers are the ones who are punished. "Restorative justice" offers hope for the future.

Medicaid Swallowing Up State, Federal Budgets
By MIKE SALINERO  <mailto:msalinero@tampatrib.com> msalinero@tampatrib.com
Published: Jan 21, 2003 

       
 <http://utils.mediageneral.com/RealMedia/ads/click_lx.ads/www.tampatrib.com/news/story.htm/1807/Position1/OasDefault/t_TBO_Pillow_Ad/TATE250b.gif/63663765316338313365326433626430>  <http://utils.media-general.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/www.tampatrib.com/news/story.htm@Position1?x>        
TALLAHASSEE - It was a good idea: Workers pay a small amount of their taxes into a health insurance program for the poor and disabled. 

But the well-intentioned Medicaid program has metastasized into a budget-busting monster, creating migraines for legislatures already struggling with the worst state government financial crises in memory. 

And in Florida, where today Gov. Jeb Bush unveils what he concedes will be an austere budget, advocates for the state's 2 million Medicaid recipients worry some of those vulnerable citizens will lose care that keeps them alive and healthy. 

``The real tragic irony here is that when families need Medicaid most, when the economy softens as it is now, state government is saying we will cut back access,'' said Jack Levine, president of Voices for Florida's Children. 

Medicaid budgets, funded jointly by federal and state governments, are exploding under the same unrelenting medical cost inflation that is wreaking havoc with private insurance plans. 

In 1987, Medicaid made up about 10 percent of state budgets. That's grown to 20 percent. In Florida, it's the second-largest item in the budget at a cost this year of $11.4 billion. 

``Every hiccup in the Medicaid program is a major stomachache for the rest of the state budget,'' said Len Nichols, an economist with the Maryland- based Center for Studying Health Systems Change. 

Florida Reins In Costs 

In many respects, Florida's Medicaid program is in better fiscal position than most states. The agency has reduced its budget by more than $1 billion during the past four years. The savings were accomplished by restraining prescription drug costs, channeling thousands of recipients into managed care organizations and ferreting out the fraud and abuse endemic in Medicaid programs. 

Florida Medicaid finished fiscal year 2001-02 with a deficit of just more than $10 million out of a $10.1 billion budget. This year, Medicaid Director Bob Sharpe is predicting the agency will wind up with a surplus of more than $11 million. 

``I don't know exactly,'' Sharpe said, ``but I suspect there are very few state Medicaid programs that are predicting a surplus for the current fiscal year. ... Right now we're fortunate.'' 

Despite Florida's success in reining in costs, the program grew 12.5 percent this fiscal year. And without a major rebound in the economy, Florida could be looking at a similar increase or worse next year. 

The growth in the program is particularly troublesome in a year when lawmakers are scrambling to pay for costly amendments mandating lower class sizes in public schools and a universal prekindergarten program. Last week, Senate President Jim King suggested some beneficiaries might have to be cut as the Legislature looks for ways to plug a potential $4 billion deficit. 

``We would love not to have to touch it,'' King said. ``If we do, it will be well thought out.'' 

Among the cuts legislators might consider are in the $368 million Medically Needy program, which covers prescription drugs and other services for people who don't have insurance but don't qualify for regular Medicaid. 

The Legislature also could lower income levels that determine Medicaid eligibility. For instance, roughly 5,800 pregnant women with incomes between 150 percent and 185 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for prenatal care. For a family of four, that's an annual income of between $27,150 and $33,485. If the Legislature lowers the eligible income level to 150 percent, they would lose those benefits. 

Losing Doctors 

Another looming problem is a dwindling physician network. Sharpe said Florida has traditionally had one of the lowest fee-reimbursement schedules in the country. Increases in recent years have not kept up with medical inflation. 

Sharpe worries the Legislature will decline to make any meaningful increase this year, forcing more doctors out of the Medicaid provider network. 

``Probably the most significant problem we're facing right now is sustaining our physician network at the fees we're able to pay,'' he said. 

Hillsborough County physician Roberto Garcia-Ibanez said reimbursement rates in Florida are laughable. Garcia- Ibanez, an allergist and immunologist, said Texas, where he once practiced, pays doctors much more for Medicaid recipients. 

``Here it is a terrible situation,'' he said. ``It's prompted a lot of doctors not to see Medicaid patients, and this is a tragedy.'' 

There are areas in the state where certain types of care are unavailable to Medicaid patients. Levine, the children's advocate, said he met the mother of a child with cerebral palsy who lives in Hamilton County on the Georgia border. The only option for getting her child the care he needs is to put him in a foster home 70 miles away in Gainesville. Even then the care isn't guaranteed. 

Sharpe said he hopes Medicaid will be able to cover cuts in appropriations this year through further cost controls and leveraging more federal money. Florida has instituted groundbreaking cost controls in the Medicaid prescription drug program that have reduced expenditures by $500 million during the past five years. 

But even with those savings, prescription drug spending continues to grow at 13 percent to 14 percent. Nursing home spending is also on the rise. If Florida's population continues to grow at the same rates as the 1990s, and if it continues to be a retirement haven, Medicaid could easily become a $53 billion program by 2015. That's equivalent to the size of the entire state budget now.

Subject:	Scripps Howard wants your Superbowl pick

Good Morning Governor Bush,

I am a reporter with Scripps Howard News Service in Washington, D.C., and
each year we ask government officials, business people and celebrities, who
they think will win the Superbowl. 
All the guesses end up in Scripps Howard newspapers across the country and
it's scheduled to appear on Access Hollywood.
I'd love to know who you think will win, what their best advantage is and
what the score will be.
We have a prize for the person who guesses the score closest to the actual
result!
Please let me know as soon as possible.
Thank you so much for your time and help.

Sincerely,
Katie McFarland

Dear board members,
In doing research in the state of Hispanic girls, I found this national organization who has put out a comprehensive and detail study on this issue. Please study this important study.  http://www.hispanichealth.org/stateofgirls.pdf <http://www.hispanichealth.org/stateofgirls.pdf>   or www.cossmho.org This is a real problem for the state of Florida future. I think that the lead we have taken in Sarasota County will be a role model for others. Because our program is so well tailored to the age group and the segment of the population. We have been able to do something no one else has done before. The success of the program and the trust parents have on us is already a winner to be promoted in all venues in our community. This problem belongs to everyone in the state of Florida. We should discuss this study in our next board meeting.

Subject:	US Airways flight between PNS and DCA

Governor,

Below is a copy of a letter Jeff Miller's office sent to Sec Mineta re: a PNS to DC direct flight. One thing the Miller letter did not mention was the fact that because of our massive military presence, DC is Pensacola Airport's number one destination. Generals, Admirals, consultants, etc, are constantly flying to do business at the Pentagon or at defense-related businesses. This direct flight route would open Northwest Florida to amazing business opportunities that are simply not available at present because of the logistical difficulties related to reaching NWFL. 

Norm Mineta has not responded as of yet and I would greatly, greatly appreciate any help you could provide in making this happen for NWFL.

Please call whenever you can. I want to share some news. It will take less than two minutes.

THE LETTER SENT TO SEC MINETA:

Re:	US Airways' Application to Serve Pensacola, Florida Nonstop 
from Washington National Airport  (Docket OST-2000-7182)


Dear Secretary Mineta:

	We are writing in strong support of  US Airways' application to provide nonstop service between Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) and Pensacola, Florida.  

US Airways' application for within-perimeter exemptions will result in extensive consumer benefits by offering the only nonstop service between DCA and Pensacola from the entire D.C. metro area.  US Airways' application will effectively give the entire northwest region of Florida convenient twice daily service to the nation's capital.  

US Airways is uniquely positioned to offer substantial consumer and competitive benefits with convenient, on-line, one-stop service from Pensacola to and from 19 communities in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region including Norfolk, White Plains (NY), New York City (LGA), Hartford, Providence, Boston, Manchester, Burlington, Syracuse, Rochester, Toronto, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Dayton, Indianapolis, Louisville, Albany and Philadelphia.  This would provide numerous benefits to consumers and communities in northwestern Florida by generating revenue and employment opportunities as well as offering convenient nonstop air service for business and leisure travelers. 

The new service will also provide critically needed additional revenue for US Airways as it seeks to emerge from bankruptcy early this year.  Continuing air service is essential to our nation's economy and the economy of Florida.  Therefore, we urge you to award US Airways the within-perimeter slots as requested.

Dear Jeb,

It has come to my attention that the CINS/SINS program is about to be eliminated.  I know that you have to have a balanced budget and I know some programs need to be cut, but why go after a program that serves a population that  is not served by any other program.
We are raising, what is termed by 5 counselors, a difficult to raise child.  He is brilliant, way over the gifted range, and a high school dropout.  He has , because of services offered by CINS become a GED graduate and he did it in 40 days.  We are not at the poverty level, but the counseling tht we received at CINS was much better than any we received in the private sector.  I really feel our child and possibly me would have wound up in a mental institution, if it wasn't for these services.  Our counselor was in constant communication with us, and our private counselors returned our calls at their convenience.  Would you rather pay their salaries, or risk having another inmate in the state prisons?  Think about it.
sincerely,
Margaret M. Weatherby

Governor Bush:
 
In light of your recent budget announcements regarding higher education spending, and the visit by Tom Huber (Collegis CEO) to the IT Florida gathering last week, perhaps this would be a good time for the State of Florida to form a private/public partnership with Collegis, a Florida technology company, for revenue generation and positive return on investment in higher education technology. See our successful results at a community college in Utah, detailed below.

Salt Lake Community College more than doubles online coursework enrollments through Collegis partnership

 

Enhanced technology services strengthen teaching and learning, raise revenues, reduce costs

 

Maitland, Fla. and Salt Lake City, Utah - Jan. 21, 2003 -- Superior technology management services and higher education expertise have helped increase student enrollments, college revenues and overall interest in online education at Salt Lake Community College just one year into a five-year contract with Collegis, the college's technology management partner.

 

The statistics, which were recently presented to the SLCC Board of Trustees, reveal that online programs, known at the college as eEducation, have more than doubled from 3,195 in spring semester 2002 to 7,140 at the end of the enrollment period for spring semester 2003. Course offerings in various subject areas have increased from 130 sections to 353 sections, including a mix of exclusively online and blended (in-class and online) education. An economics course has also been developed and is now being offered online to students in Asia through a partnership between SLCC and Shanghai Teachers University.

 

Collegis, based in suburban Orlando, Fla., is the leading provider of comprehensive technology solutions and services to higher education. The corporation's technology management partnership with SLCC has been instrumental in generating more revenues for SLCC by streamlining operations, boosting enrollments, improving campus communications and creating a better learning environment for students at this thriving Utah college. SLCC signed a five year, $26.5 million technology management contract with Collegis in December 2001.

 

Since the start of the partnership one year ago, Collegis and SLCC staff members have met the college's strategic goals of working to implement and support appropriate technologies to enhance teaching and learning and to maximize the effectiveness and efficiencies of campus operations. By leveraging Collegis' expertise in higher education technology management, SLCC has also realized significant return on investment (ROI) and great value from the outsourced technology business partnership.

 

Collegis upgrades and maintenance to the WebCT course management platform, which includes Web hosting and 24/7 help desk support, have helped save SLCC nearly $1.4 million in cost avoidance of a new platform and ongoing instructional technology assistance fees, according to SLCC. Also, by providing on-site Collegis consultants to oversee the college's recent SCT Banner software migration, SLCC has experienced cost-avoidance savings of nearly $750,000. An estimated $420,000 savings in purchasing and licensing fees over the course of the contract creates further value via the creation of an integrated learning environment, which includes a Campus Pipeline portal and SCT Banner software.

 

"Our strategic goals for this partnership were to improve teaching and learning through the use of technology and to generate revenues through a more innovative and efficient use of technology resources on campus," said H. Lynn Cundiff, president at Salt Lake Community College. "We've been able to accomplish these goals already, with impressive ROI and value from this relationship, and we still have four years remaining to work together and build on this success."

 

An eEducation Strategic Action Plan, developed in collaboration between Collegis and SLCC faculty and staff, has been produced to forecast growth opportunities for the next four years of the technology management contract.

 

About Collegis Inc.

Founded in 1986, Collegis Inc. is a leading provider of integrated strategic advisory, education delivery and technology management solutions to higher education institutions in the United States. The Company's solutions address an array of technology-related issues facing colleges and universities, including institutional strategic assessment and planning, implementation of learning technology initiatives, new curricula design and long-term management of technology resources.

A Day ON, Not A Day Off! 

 This past Monday, Americans across the country celebrated the national holiday honoring the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As they have since 1994, thousands of Americans remembered Dr. King by serving in their communities—making the holiday "a day ON, not a day off." 

During his lifetime, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. sought to forge the common ground on which people from all walks of life could join together as equals to address important community issues. Volunteerism and service, he realized, was the great equalizer. We salute all of Florida’s volunteers who serve their community. As Dr. King once said, "Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve." Visit www.mlkday.org for more information on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service.

Citizens Protect Homeland Security 

 Floridians are “stepping up” in response to President Bush’s call to protect America. Operation Step Up utilizes volunteer centers, local emergency management, law enforcement and fire rescue workers in order to recruit volunteers for new training and service opportunities in homeland security and disaster response. 

In December, seven Big Bend area organizations participated in a Disaster Volunteer Reception Center (VRC) tabletop exercise. A VRC is set up in the effected community in the event of a disaster or emergency to greet and register people wanting to volunteer. Using a table size VRC floor plan, participants assigned resources and staff, practiced operating the center and reviewed procedures for recruiting disaster relief volunteers. The exercise was coordinated by the Capital Area Chapter of the American Red Cross in partnership with Volunteer Leon, Florida State University Center for Civic Education and Service, Community Crisis Response Team, Big Bend Disaster Animal Response Team, Humane Society of the U. S. and the Florida Department of State Volunteer Office. 

Volunteer Lee (County), in partnership with Lee County Emergency Management, FIND of Lee County and the Salvation Army, hosted a VRC exercise in October. Trainees role-played VRC staff and spontaneous volunteers to be better prepared to utilize an influx of disaster relief volunteers. Volunteer Lee followed up in December with presentations by emergency management and law enforcement on the importance of volunteers in their agencies. Volunteer Lee was awarded $15,000 this year to implement the Disaster Volunteer Management and Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) initiatives of Operation Step Up. 

Operation Step Up is a Volunteer Florida program made possible by the Corporation for National and Community Service. Eleven volunteer centers and dozens of emergency response agencies around the state are engaging Floridians in Operation Step Up homeland security and disaster preparedness programs. For more information about Operation Step Up, contact Alfred “AC” Claud at alfred@volunteerflorida.org or visit www.volunteerflorida.org and click on Emergency Management.

The Power of Five 

 America's Promise has a new citizenship/service-learning curriculum for 11-14 year olds called The Power of Five. The Power of Five is a five-session plan (including activity sheets) that emphasizes youth involvement in delivering the 5 promises (caring adult, safe place, healthy start, marketable skills, and opportunity to serve). "The best place to find a helping hand is at the end of your own arm." This Swedish proverb describes the soul of The Power of Five, encouraging young people to lend a hand to kids in their community. 

The Power of Five asks tweens to do their part in making sure that every young person has what they need to grow up as a happy and healthy successful adult citizen. The activities and instructor's guide will help facilitate the group's efforts as young people evaluate and research their volunteer or service options. They will commit at least five days to fulfilling the Five Promises to kids their age or younger. To learn more about the Power of Five curriculum, visit America's Promise at: www.americaspromise.org/poweroffive.

OK. What's going on? I couldn't find an environmentalist to complain about a 
20 percent cut in environmental spending in the proposed budget. That was 
amazing. They're all happy, happy, happy with the Everglades and Florida 
Forever funding and tickled over a reduction in beach renourishment.


But I do hope to find someone on Wednesday who can explain this proposal to 
move the many little trust funds into the general fund.

You won't be able to read all this---but skim to see the importance of botany/biology at UCF. Specifically this is about the Arboretum land, used by both the public and student body---which the new Plan calls for a parking garage to be built upon.   The cited recommendations are sound ones.

Subject:  Proposed Land Use Amendment to UCF Master Plan

 

Dear Mr. Merck:

 

On behalf of the Sierra Club of Central Florida, and the Sierra Club Florida Chapter, I have reviewed the proposed master amendment for the University of Central Florida (UCF).  We thank you for the presentation of the master plan update and tour of the campus in May of 2001.   Our response is as follows:

 

*        Transit, Circulation and Parking Element

The circulation systems pose a significant challenge to the campus with potential to fragment the east side. We object to Policy 1.17:  a major new parking facility, such as the one envisioned on the east side.   This area is an upland of 10 to 12 acres is used for teaching plant identification.  We support this location for the new greenhouse and future environmental center.  We suggest high usage of multi-modal centers for the western portion of the University, i.e. along the Alafaya Road corridor and near University main entrance. We recommend a study of a mass transit system similar to that of Orlando area theme parks.

 

*        We support the binding protection and of the “natural communities of the arboretum 

including the scrub site.  I would like to emphasize Sierra’s desire that no further loss of scrub habitat at UCF be considered.  These ecologically diverse communities are located in the Econlockhatchee River Basin designated as an Outstanding Florida Water (OFW) established by Chapter 62-302, F.A.C.  The Econlockhatchee River system is a water designated worthy of special protection because of its natural attributes.  This special designation is applied to certain waters with the intent of maintaining existing good water quality.  Protection of this area will assist in preventing the lowering of existing water quality while preserving and defining the  boundaries of this property.

 

*        We object to siting of Greek housing in the Conservation Area of the northwest quadrant

 of the UCF campus.  Sierra opposed this proposal in April of 1997, shortly after the Board of Regents approved the plan in 1995.    The Greek housing proposal would impact a diverse area designated as a relocation site for gopher tortoise and Florida mice.  Plant communities consist of imperiled longleaf pine-turkey oak sandhill and sandpine scrub. We continue to support binding protection to sustain the ecological integrity of this upland area.  Sierra’s involvement in the master planning process dates to 1992.  After several years of significant time and resources, Sierra believed the University would truly protect this area.  It is disheartening that the request for private housing has surfaced again.  I understand that in 1997, a process to develop eight possible alternative locations for expansion was under review by the Administration.  I would like to emphasize that Sierra does not support any private housing in conservation areas.

 

*        218 Acre Golf Course

This proposed golf course located on the southeast side of the campus composes 15% of the University’s acreage.  We do not support the location of a golf course on campus. Sierra suggests possible consideration for expansion of on-campus housing in this area given the limitations of space to sustain an exploding student population. 

 

We believe the above recommendations preserve the unique ecological environment that is the basic building block for the University of Central Florida campus.   Additionally, we believe our objections and recommendations will contribute to the regional protection of the Econlockhatchee River Basin as established by Chapter 62-302, F.A.C.

 

Thank you for consideration of our recommendations to the proposed Master Plan amendment.  We look forward to your response.

 

Sincerely,

Subject: Re: UCF Plan


I think state agencies are supposed to be part of the review process---until Jan. 7, I guess, "state law required that state officials make the final decision" (quote from today's SENTINEL), and evidently alot of folk lobbied state officials for months in opposition. ("Because of this, final approval has been delayed since August").  But "on Jan 7, the Florida Board of Governors delegated such decisions to university boards". 
Which virtually leaves any and everybody impacted by this with no redress. 
They call it an "update" of the 1995 plan---but on the 1995 plan there were 72 acres of "preserved" uplands which contained then and still contain federally endangered and threatened wildflower species, and significant gopher tortoise populations which already had been relocated under the blessing of Fish & Wildlife provided that was to be their permanent home:  Where the 2010 plan ("update") now shows new fraternity housing is the wild upland tortoise habitat meant to be preserved on the 1995 plan.  And there is, I gather, no lasting inviolable protection for those "wild preserve areas" that ARE left on the new updated plan! (This, bear in mind, at a university with a quite significant biology/ecology component.)
The sole public hearing on this is Thurs. and they have (it SEEMS) deliberately made it difficult for people to speak at all---even the public notice was in the paper late.
 
Because of the new change in the law maybe there is nothing you can do.  And I certainly don't know all the nuances of this---Sue Eberle's grasp of the minutae is far greater and better researched than mine.  
But basically it sounds like this plan is being pushed thru over vociferous objections.
 
I will get those other texts to you ASAP tonight.  
 
I understand, if it is out of your hands. 
 
In any event, I appreciate your time very much.

Dear Governor,
 
Later today I will forward you a few more samples of "well-reasoned" opposition to the 1010 Master Plan the UCF Board of Trustees on Thursday plans to adopt.  I will try to edit or condense where possible, but am hoping to give you sort of an overview of peoples' objections, from the different sectors, in their own words. (Sierra Club, Friends of the Arboretum, biologists who have surveyed the federally endangered and threatened species on the acres the Master Plan would encroach on, etc.)
 
I know YOU are pressed for time and that on its face this may seem like a local yokel issue, but there are reasons to look at the projected goals of this and the process from a State level perspective, given the tax $$$ I presume will go in service of this Master Plan. And there is a certain exigency to this matter for us---so I hope to get this all to you in time to peruse before Thursday.
 
Again, thank you for your time, your patience, and your attention. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Rebecca

FYI. e-mail response below from Mrs. Light. I spoke with Mrs. Light by telephone today and coordinated with the Area 3 Medicaid office to begin locating a provider. If we can't find a qualified physician in Ocala, we shouldn't have any problem locating a physician nearby in Orlando. Mrs. Light also mentioned her friend's adaptive telephone is "not working", so I made a referral to the nearest Center for Independent Living to offer Ms. Simon assistance with her phone and any other challenges related to her hearing impairment. I have encouraged Mrs. Light to contact me or the Area 3 office directly if she needs any additional assistance.

Crime is down because people are getting involved...especially after Sept 11...across the state crime prevention officers and departments are increasing their citizen involvement...thru neighborhood watch and other community policing efforts....Jeb...they could have used a better line than this...

Jeb, before you announce how you are going to meet this class size issue, I would like you to talk to my dad about my idea. The people in our community are fully for it, as well as Needlemans son that works in the senate. Please keep in mind my father established the first community college in the the US, Northern Virginia Community College. Don't freak out but we want it and the support is there. Get rid of 12 th grade now. It's a waste of time, 18 year olds have no business in with 14 year olds. The last year 12th, is spent making up stupid credits for the Southern Association of Colleges. Scenario, someone wants to be a scientist, why are they taking PE or art? Here's your money saver. What is it?$ 5,280 per student? Make 12th grade first year of college. If you attend in the state we pick up the cost. RE: UCF/BCC what $52 credit hour x 12 full time credits equals how much? We reduce class sizes, save on building new schools and everyone wins! I would rather pay $624 per semester than throw away $5280 per year. It makes sense and cents.
Let me know, there is a push for it in the grassroots organizations.

Hi Gov. Bush:
 
My name is John I live here in Winter Haven, and I wanted to say thank you for your help over your recent campaign. You had come to Munn Park in Lakeland, just days before the election.  I was the guy in the wheel Chair that had asked you about how do I get help for my prescriptions. I anted to say that finally this week all of the paper work that had went through paid off and I was able to get my Medicine directly from the manufacturer Bristol-Meyers.
 
So many I know come to you asking for help here and there, but I wanted to come back to you through an email and say thank you so much for what you and your office did for me.  Will you ever be back to Lakeland anytime soon?
 
I wish I could personally shake your hand to say thank you for your help and the help of your staff!
 
Sincerely
 
John

I respectfully request you give favorable consideration to the appointment of Phillip E. (Buddy) Johnson
to the office of Supervisor of Elections in Hillsborough County. Since he was an able and popular legislator
in this district, the citizens would understand and approve of his appointment over the other candidates for
this position.
 
Presently serving as Director of Real Estate, Buddy would be welcomed back to Hillsborough County in this
important position, where he once was a successful businessman.
 
I hope to see you at the Strawberry Festival in March.  While President,  I enjoyed squiring your mother and
dad around the fairgrounds on several occasions.  And, as a Naval Aviator, I have always felt a  bond to your dad.

Subject: Everglades Phosphorus Criterion


Jeb:

Attached (MS Word File) and below you will find a copy of the joint
position of the largest possible segment of the environmental community
concerning the Everglades phosphorus issue.

The intent of what you see here is to pursue a truly workable and practical
resolution of the phosphorus issue - one which will answer the fundamental
question "what happens when enforcement begins on December 31, 2006?"

The bottom line is that should the 10ppb standard not be immediately met in
the early days of enforcement (2007) the administration of this standard
through DEP's permit system should require the development and
implementation of additional measures to reach further in the direction of
attaining the standard. We should not stop the process for litigation over
variances, and similar controversial "relief mechanisms". We should get
right to the business at hand - improving the discharges, requiring the
permittees to keep trying until it is done.  

Our friends in the sugar industry are spending a lot of time predicting
armageddon on December 31, 2006 if a solid 10ppb standard is adopted for
the whole Everglades. That is not how we see it; we want and see a path to
continued progress. 

Some actual rule language to accomplish the position that is attached has
been forwarded by us to Ken Wright. 

We hope you will help us accomplish this -- rather than the route to
trouble and conflict that is being marketed by some of our friends in the
sugar industry, in which the Everglades would be divided into areas with
multiple standards (some of which would sacrifice those parts of the
Everglades affected) and in which the future would be full of litigation
over variances, mixing zones and similar "relief mechanisms".

Charles

	Re:  10ppb Phosphorus Water Quality Standard for Everglades Protection Area

Dear Governor Bush:

We fully support and commend your proposal to the Environmental Regulation
Commission to establish a numerical water quality standard of 10 ppb
phosphorus criterion to be adopted by rule for the Everglades Protection
Area.  We were delighted by Secretary Nortonfs announcement at the
Everglades Coalition meeting on January 10, 2003 that the Department of the
Interior also supports 10 ppb.  

This phosphorous water quality numerical standard was backed by solid
scientific research in 1994 and has been further validated by subsequent
research.  In the eight years since the Everglades Forever Act was enacted,
the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of the Interior,
and the South Florida Water Management District have all carried out
studies supporting the numerical 10ppb standard.  From 1999 to Jan 2001
alone, over 110 scientific reports were published that are relevant to an
Everglades numeric criterion, bringing the number of published science
reports to over 400.

It may not be practical or possible for all permitted deliveries of water
to meet the water quality standard for the entire Everglades Protection
Area by December 31, 2006 as required by law.  This should not lead to
drafting a rule that allows permit applicants to undermine the intent of
the law.  Such a rule would be both unwise and unnecessary.  The rule as
anticipated by the Legislature in 1994 should be a clear science-based
statement of a limit based on eliminating adverse impacts.  Issues of
compliance can be handled in the permits issued by the Department of
Environmental Protection.  This is in fact what the Everglades Forever Act
requires.  It is also what is required by the federal Clean Water Act
delegation to the State of Florida.

The undersigned organizations urge you to support a rule that sets out the
phosphorous criterion without including provisions related to compliance.
The final rule should not contain references to variances, mixing zones,
and other more uncertain relief mechanisms.  

Governor Bush, establishing the phosphorous criterion is one of the most
important decisions facing the Everglades restoration at this time.  It
will provide the foundation for other major Everglades decisions and
restoration activities. We commend your leadership on Everglades
restoration and your support of the scientifically sound numerical standard
of 10 ppb phosphorus, 
The Honorable Jeb Bush

Attachment:   Position on Everglades Phosphorous Criterion


1. The 1994 Everglades Forever Act establishes a gdefault standardh of 10
parts per billion for phosphorus in the gEverglades Protection Areah, a
zone comprised of all of the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and
Everglades National Park. We support the implementation of this 10 part per
billion standard, which will take effect by operation of law on December
31, 2003, and will begin to be implemented under existing law on December
31, 2006.

2. The 10 part per billion phosphorus criterion, which was backed by solid
scientific research in 1994, has been further validated by research
undertaken by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and South
Florida Water Management District in the 8 years that have passed since the
law was enacted. No case of merit has been presented that this criterion
should be changed. 

3. The clear intent of the Everglades Forever Act was that the phosphorus
criterion should be applicable in all parts of the Everglades Protection
Area. There is no support in the law, and no convincing support in any
scientific research, to justify more than one phosphorus criteria, or to
suggest that the Everglades Protection Area may be divided into different
zones where varying criteria are applied.

4. Current performance of the gStormwater Treatment Areash (STAs)
required by the Everglades Forever Act demonstrates that with optimization,
these facilities can reduce phosphorus in the STA discharges to 15 parts
per billion or less. With the further application of Submerged Aquatic
Vegetation optimization methods in the STAs, and the prospect of
establishing periphyton based cells in or adjacent to the current STAs,
compliance with a 10 ppb standard appears to be within reasonable grasp.
Optimization of Best Management Practices, currently not being done, could
further reduce phosphorus concentrations in farm fields before effluent
even reaches the STAs, AND should be pursued as a major next step in the
phosphorus reduction strategy.

5. It is possible, that small parts of the Everglades Protection Area will
receive discharges somewhat greater than 10 parts per billion after the
December 31, 2006 compliance date in the Everglades Forever Act.  This is
neither justification to alter the standard required to protect the
Everglades, nor justification for gvariancesh, gmixing zonesh or other
grelief mechanismsh which provide an open-ended waiver of enforcement of
the 10 ppb criterion. The Everglades Forever Act includes two features that
deal with non-compliance situations.  First, the Act rules out gc"Mixing
zones, variances, and moderating provisions, or relief mechanismsch for
phosphorus. Next, the act establishes a special kind of permit, known as a
gLong Term Compliance Permith.  In the event that discharges anticipated
under this permit will not meet the phosphorus criterion, the permittee is
required to develop a plan for achieving compliance, cost estimates for
that plan, a funding mechanism for the plan, and a proposed schedule for
implementation. Reliance on this process already in the law obviates the
need for variances, mixing zones, and other more uncertain relief
mechanisms.

6. In the proceeding now before the Environmental Regulation Commission
(ERC), we advocate that a straightforward 10 part per billion criterion be
adopted as a rule. If a majority of the current membership of the ERC
cannot support approval of a rule establishing 10 ppb criterion in the
absence of additional rule language that attempts to allow blanket
variances, mixing zones and similar broad  grelief mechanismsh with
uncertain outcomes and deadlines, then the Department of Environmental
Protection should terminate the rulemaking proceeding it initiated, and
rely upon the 10 part per billion default standard which is present in the
law.

Dear Governor Bush;

My sister (Michelle Perrin) is in the 9th grade at Port St. Joe High School. 
She is in a gifted class, and they have been assigned to ask a public 
official a few questions about their personal views on freedom of the press 
and how it affects them. She would be THRILLED if you could do this for her. 
Short answers are great.

Here are the questions. I understand if you are not able to do this. Thank 
you-and keep up the excellent work.

Rachel Perrin

1.  What do you feel about the First Amendment guarentee free press? I FEEL IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. FREEDOM OF THE PRESS ALSO PROTECTS YOU AND I TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT AS WELL.
2.  How do you like it when people/reporters ask you personal questions? I DON'T MIND IT. THEY HAVE A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO DO SO AND I HAVE A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT NOT TO ANSWER. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A ZONE OF PRIVACY FOR PEOPLE IN PUBLIC LIFE. 
3.  What about when you answer a question, but when they repeat it, it is 
completey different... Are you surprised? Do you feel abused? Or is it fair 
because of the law..... What is your opinion on that? THE PRESS SOMETIMES KEEPS ASKING THE SAME QUESTION TO TRY TO GET THE ANSWER THEY WANT. THIS CAN SOMETIMES BE A GAME. I TRY TO HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FORTHRIGHTLY AND CONSISTENTLY WHILE NOT FALLING INTO TRAPS.
4.  Or when they misinterpret quotes of other people, what do you feel about 
this? I DON'T LIKE SHODDY JOURNALISM.
5.  If a scandal were to occur, do you want to know exactly what happened? 
Very detailed?  If so, do you feel it is okay for reporters to bombard the 
people about information?  If not, why? IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF ISSUE BEING COVERED.
6.  Should there ever be limits on the press?  On what they say, print, or 
even do to obtain their information? THERE SHOULD BE LIMITS ON THE PRESS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE FOR ALL OF US. WE SHOULD BE LIMITED BY DECENCY, FAIRNESS, INTERGRITY AND HONESTY.

THANKS FOR WRITING.

JEB BUSH

Dear Jeb,
Good morning! I want to let you now about a problem of one of the family that I have mentor for over 5 years. The father has been dead for over 7 years. Rosa has left with a large family. The girls have drop out from school and I have been working with the last two. Ana is in high school, she is very bright and full of life even when tragedy has plague the family. Emily who is 11 is in the program. She is very petite and looks like she is 6 years old. 
       The problem Rosa has is quiet large and she has been tormented for so long. The boys have been involved in gang activities and the older one has moved from the house. The 17 years old Oscar was involved in a fight about 2 years ago and during the fight he kill another boy. He was found not guilty, because he was defending him self. The Sarasota County School will not allowed him to return back to school. He only have a ninth grade education and he is very smart and a very good artist. 
       Rosa need help with him and I am trying to find a different place to move the family. I want to know if there is a state program where we can send Oscar to bring some help to Rosa. She is very sick and I am afraid for her and the girls. Oscar is not working and spends his time at home and on the streets, he is about to get in more trouble if we don't find help. She need help so she can have some peace and be able to enjoy the girls. I am doing a lot with no resources. Last night I talk to Rosa over one hour giving her hope. 
Thank you for listening to this problem,

Subject:	Age Limit For Club Could Fall In Weeks

"State law allows patrons 18 to 20 years old inside nightclubs, though they cannot drink alcohol."
COMMENT: This makes about as much sense as anything else that happens in Florida.  This could be one reason why children like your daughter Noelle have drug problems.   
=============================================================
Age Limit For Club Could Fall In Weeks

By SHANNON BEHNKEN 
sbehnken@tampatrib.com 
Published: Jan 22, 2003 


TAMPA - Eighteen-year-olds could be allowed inside The Amphitheater nightclub in Ybor City as early as the first week of February. 
The Tampa City Council had denied owner John Santoro's request in June to lift the 21- and-older restriction they placed on his club. But Hillsborough Circuit Judge Herbert Baumann Jr. ruled Jan. 10 that the council failed to prove that lifting the restriction would have an adverse effect on the entertainment district. 
``I'm so glad a fair and impartial person came in and made the right ruling,'' said Santoro, who also owns Club Hedo. 
On Jan. 30, the council is scheduled to give final approval to lifting the restriction, and the mayor is expected to sign it the next day, City Attorney James Palermo said. 
State law allows patrons 18 to 20 years old inside nightclubs, though they cannot drink alcohol. 
Santoro agreed to only admit those 21 and older when he opened The Amphitheater in 1998. 
The city council cannot impose such a requirement on bars, but Santoro said it was clear the council would not otherwise approve his zoning application to serve alcohol. 
In an attempt to curb underage drinking, council members hoped other bar owners would agree to the age restrictions when applying for zoning changes, Councilwoman Linda Saul-Sena said. 
``The trend is to make the requirement citywide,'' she said. 
But The Amphitheater remains the only club in Ybor City that cannot admit 18- to 20-year-olds. 
Santoro went before the council in May with a new zoning application seeking to lift the restriction. He said it wasn't fair to single out his club and that the age limit cut his profit by about $2 million. 
In June, the council voted 4-3 to keep the restriction. 
Council members have discussed passing an ordinance prohibiting anyone younger than 21 from entering a bar. Palermo has advised against it, saying such a restriction would be unlawful. 
He said he sent a proposed bill to state Rep. Sandra Murman, R-Tampa, in October that would give cities and counties the authority to set such limits, but he hasn't heard back. 
``I assume it's not something we'll see on this year's agenda,'' Palermo said. 
Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale have similar ordinances and are fighting for them in court. A Broward County judge upheld the law, but the case is being appealed. 
Tampa Councilwoman Mary Alvarez, who favors a citywide restriction, said she is ``disappointed that the court saw fit for the 18- to 20-year- olds to go into the club.'' 
``I don't want to be the big government telling bar owners what to do, but underage drinking is a big problem,'' she said. ``It's always possible for people to buy these underage kids drinks when they're inside.'' 
It is difficult for bar owners to keep an eye on the underage patrons, Saul-Sena said.

Jeb:
 
Just a few words about the past four years at the South Florida Water Management District.  
 
After a very rough start, our Governing Board has been able to get on track and influence a number of water management objectives that have, in my humble opinion, contributed to making your first term a successful one.  From land acquisition, to the implementation of One Florida in procurement practices, to the allocation of funds for flood control projects in South Florida, we have been diligent and aggressive, but there is still much more to do in a very challenging fiscal environment.  To that end, should you decide to appoint me for a second term, I would be pleased and honored to continue to serve.

Dear Friends:
If you want to be of help, please forward this information to others.  
As the director of StarCoast-Academy, a not for profit school that offers post secondary courses for the incarcerated, I have personal information about the present conditions and problems. 
Educational, vocational programs and drug programs have been so slashed that there is little opportunity for rehabilitation in our Florida prisons.  
StarCoast-Academy tries to offer academic options to as many inmates as we can afford, but it is not nearly enough!
Please read this letter and forward it to others so that Florida citizens become aware of the dire problems of the present Florida DOC polices.

Dear Governor Bush:
Since you have taken office the mission statement for the Department of Corrections has been changed to: Safe, Humane, and Efficient.  

I see that it is not gummed up by any high ideals of rehabilitation and preparation of inmate return to society.  Our prisons have become nothing more than human holding cells housing oppressed people, serving extended time, without any means of correction or redemption.

Being a prisoner in Florida means being hungry.  In the name of efficiency the state has given the contract to a company offering food for pennies a day.  I had an inmate write that said the meat served just covered the bowl of his teaspoon.  He was given the choice to eat it or not.

It means shivering in the cold.  The DOC does not have enough warm clothing or bedding to issue this winter.  A deficiency of long johns, of underwear, of warm sox, or lined jackets means being chilled to the bone.  

Being in Florida's prison system means having a greatly diminished future. Inmates have little opportunity to learn a trade or a job skill since most of our prison programs have been cut in the name of efficiency.

It might mean a toothache because the dental care is backlogged from six months to a year.

It could mean that medical treatment is withheld, as in the case of my son, delayed until it was too late to operate.

It means living in a hostile environment because the officers and guards are low paid, under trained, and emotionally stressed.  Being an inmate in Florida means being personally degraded, dehumanized, and threatened by DOC staff with an absolute power that runs unchecked and unquestioned.  

Safety or security only pertains to Correctional officers and staff, concern for safety doesn't include inmates.  Inmates can be raped, or beaten, or gassed, or set up for false charges, and no one in Florida's administration cares.

Contrary to the present philosophy of Florida, statistics show that the opportunities for rehabilitation, and how an offender is treated while incarcerated, makes more of a difference to recidivism than length of sentence.  Education, vocational and drug programs are shown to decrease the likelihood of return to prison.  

Florida continues to enforce serving longer sentences, with less and less rehabilitation.  This has not been effective here, or in other states.  We need to make changes.

Governor Bush, 

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to reading this email.  I recently read an article in the Miami Herald where the reporter stated that "the governor is proposing the state not fully reimburse community colleges or universities for Bright Futures scholarships."  As an FIU senior on Bright Futures, I don't know what to expect for this upcoming Fall semester.  If FIU says we have no money to "absorb the difference" then the difference is going to be passed on to students like me and with a tuition hike that could go from 7% to 12% depending on what emotional state our Board of Trustees or the state legislature is in, then I'm really worried.   

I guess I only have one thing to do...dress up in a flamingo costume and promote the Florida Lottery so maybe there's enough revenue to subsidize Bright Futures one more year. 

Sincerely,

Subject:	Florida Bar Commission Report on the Legal Needs of Children and the Unified Family Court

Governor Bush, it was my honor to meet you last week at the Cuban American Bar Association Installation. I am accepting your suggestion that I send to you a copy of  the memo that I sent to Rocky regarding the work of many people over the past several years to improve the plight of families caught in our legal system.  I believe that some  of the conclusions are consistent with your agenda regarding families.


I was the chairperson of The Florida Bar Commission on the Legal Needs of Children which issued its Final Report in June 2002. As you may know, that report was the result of 3 years of intensive study and research on the legal needs of children in all divisions of our courts. The commission membership included a wide variety of professionals from around the state and in the executive branch. We made comprehensive recommendations regarding confidentiality of children's' and families' records ( a very topical issue - which was addressed comprehensively for the first time in Florida); representation of children, whether by GAL or attorney, depending on their need; the need for treatment and services for children caught in our legal system; and finally, what the Bar can do regarding education of lawyers, the public and the judiciary. A large part of our work also involved a study of the need for coordinated technology between the Courts and the state agencies to better serve children.

We looked at children that are not only in the juvenile courts but in all divisions including domestic violence, criminal, civil, probate and domestic relations. What we discovered is that often children are in several courts because their families are in several courts and we are treating the family problems in segments rather than approaching the needs of the entire family to both serve them and the children in continuing in some family fashion in the future.

This 3 year study is contemporaneous in time with the work of the Family Court Steering Committee which proposed a model family court/unified family court to the Supreme Court which they adopted in May 2001. The opinion is at 794 So.2d 518 (Fla.2001) 

This unified approach to family problems means that the jurisdiction of the family court includes juvenile, domestic violence, child support and domestic relations cases. It also means that whenever possible, no matter through what portal a family may enter the system, we try to coordinate their cases before one judge. At this time, there are pilot projects in courts throughout the state that are attempting to implement this model. We have also started one here in Dade County, in which I am involved. For example, in our pilot project, we have identified 1400 children in a 6 month period that had more than 2 cases in the system - that equals at least 2800 cases( could be a child support/paternity; dependency/paternity; dependency/dissolution/domestic violence, etc)


 So far, by bringing all of the family's problems together before one judge, we are able to have comprehensive, coordinated outcomes so that families leave the system with their own solutions rather than court imposed. In other words, the Model Court minimizes the use of the traditional adversary system. It also attempts to coordinate the limited resources that are available in communities and reduce the number of times that people need to appear in court.

There is a newly created Steering Committee on Children and Families in the Courts created by Chief Justice Anstead and Secretary Regier is on that committee as am I.  That committee is charged with the responsibility to implement the unified court principles and practices.

I really believe that these efforts of looking at the problem of the whole family is part of strengthening families. If they are not going to stay together as couples, then they can at least learn how to meet the needs of their children living separately.  One of the guiding principles of the unified family court is to " focus on the needs of children who are involved in litigation, refer families to resources that will make their relationships stronger, coordinate their cases to provide consistent results, and strive to leave families in better condition than when they entered the system."  This goal is based upon the feeling that a fragmented legal system damages families and a coordinated system conserves community resources and avoids duplication of services. 

I have previously sent to your office (by snailmail) a copy of the Florida Bar's Final Report. Here is  the link to the website which includes the full report and lists the members who served on the Commission.

Mr. Jeb Bush, in his individual and personal, unofficial, capacity as a US Citizen and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, not otherwise.

I am, by the below set out communication to the President, urgently proposing and requesting a Consulting Agreement from the appropriate aspect of the United States to provide the Biowar Interactive Early Warning System and such other agreeable services as may be set out on the One Page Summary, attached.

The Biowar Interactive Warning System as proposed is believed far faster (over 200% plus) and more pervasive than the new Bioterror Monitor technique announced, today.

In all humility and modesty, I, along with competent experts (please see, below), believe the following items are sufficiently in the vital interests of the US and her allies as to bring them to the attention of the President through the below set out communications:

(1) a letter addressed to the President;

(2) a One Page Summary, attached; and,

(3) a separately forwarded e-mail letter to an attorney, MZ, detailing the history and benefits, as well as disruptive circumstances in bringing this opportunity on board during the prior administration and, failing that, the ongoing hang-over of delays, now, from the prior administration and the continuing delays, requiring bringing it to the attention of the President on order to make it available.
        
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in deference to the wisdom and discretion of Jeb Bush, I will defer to his determination should delivery to the President not be desired and one or more other actions be decided by him.

E-MAIL LETTER


URGENT
EYES ONLY


The Most Honorable George W. Bush,
President of The United States of America

Dear President Bush:

In all humility, my prayers are with you that you are successful in all you do and the wishes and desires of your heart are fulfilled and realized with Good.

I am urgently and respectfully proposing and requesting a Consulting Agreement with the United States as a Client at the earliest possible date.

The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Security Defense System (the "System") was submitted in 1997 during the Clinton Administration to be appropriately and properly implemented and make America ready with a secure homeland defense, then, and it has not been implemented or presented to you, yet, but rather misappropriated and set-on the improper track. It may be too late to perform its appropriate and proper implementation before the next Biowar attack, if we do not act, now. As the proposed system protected individual privacy, as well, its delay has caused the Bush administration and the American public terribly severe and unnecessary headaches, worry and disunity at a time when America and America's president deserve responses and solutions building for unity and security. It is time to shake off the hangover of cool idleness and indifference of the last administration and to stand up to the job of putting in the right defense for America and her allies.

The Biowar Interactive Warning System as proposed is believed far faster (over 200% plus) and more pervasive than the new Bioterror Monitor technique announced, today.

Knowing, of course, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, there can be no guarantees, the Biowar Early Warning System as proposed, before and now, appropriately and properly implemented,  would, in all humility and modesty (1) provide you, Mr. President, your Counterproliferation Technology Coordination Committee, and American and her Allies, with the necessary, but missing and critically vital  earliest real-time instrumentation revealing subtle suspicious vital life sign deviations among vast populations (2) while protecting and enhancing the privacy rights of the people, (3) and enabling the greatest in-time response for the most effective deterrence and mitigation protecting Americans and America's allies. But, the Biowar Early Warning and Defense System is still delayed since March 31st, 1997, by the hang-over from the prior administration, while America is facing its greatest terrorists risks. It was on or about that date I submitted a Proposal for the System to DARPA
 and others in the Clinton Administration by which I provided The Biowar Interactive Early Warning System White Paper forecasting the likelihood of sneak anthrax and other sneak biowar attacks against Americans and America's allies' and their populations. The Biowar Early Warning System was proposed for implementation in 1997 as the only suitable instrument  to begin protecting Americans and America's allies against the unwarranted risks perceived to  exist at that time and shown to have been, unfortunately, all too correct.

This is an e-mail re-proposal, delayed by disruptive circumstances (1) respectfully and urgently requesting an Initial Consulting Agreement for an even improved Biowar Interactive Early Warning System, recommended by Dr. Nancy Miller, (former) United States Air Force Acquisition and Program Manager, set out below, together with John F. McCarthy, Jr, attorney, a key partner in America's and the world's largest labor law firm practicing exclusively in America, (2) including a One Page Summary, attached, and (3) an e-mail letter to an attorney (MZ) (sent by separate forwarding) describing the current situation, in which almost five (5) years after submission, finally, by letter Dated January 4, 2002, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar, Ph.D., with whom I first had contact at Chemical/Biological Defense in 1999, thanks me for..."...(your)...support of the DoDChemical and biological Defense Program and for the welfare of U. S. Military forces.." as I had been continuing attempts during the Cl
inton administration to gain implementation of the Biowar Early Warning System before American lives and resources which would be saved, were tragically lost. Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar's response was most revealingly and perhaps with all due respect to her, courageous, as regarding one of the several continued submission's during the Clinton administration and well before the September 11, 2001 attacks. She disclosed that the Department had been only involved in a process for "..identifying outbreaks of non-battle related illnesses for the deployed soldiers...(and)...also working closely with civilian public health services as they develop methodologies.." but nothing more and nothing had been mentioned to have been  conceived or implemented for the comprehensive Biowar Early Warning and Defense System implementation proposed by me as an integrative contractor to provide the American population and those of America's allies with the comprehensive deterrence and mitigation protec
tion offered by the System which was offered during the Clinton Administration in 1997. Now, once the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and the time related anthrax deaths occurred, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar is quoted as saying "shame on us" for not acting earlier. Indeed. So they have announced they will do something, now, after receiving repeated proposals to provide the System and after September 11, 2001, occurred, by using the trade secreted ideas/concepts without consent of the proponent and by  spending $300,000,000 on it, but, they are admitting they do not have a model, only the ideas I tradesecreted and submitted. Moreover, they admittedly do not know how to implement it and, as a consequence they are running late, on the wrong path, and causing the Bush administration and America great unnecessary problems and greater risks.

Let American's admit we can no longer be tied to the prior administration's continuing hang-over of inaction and methods of denial resulting in no defense or a sham defense from which the Bush Administration will have to dig out.

If given a chance, I will go forward as the owner of the intellectual property and the author of and one who presented it trade secreted, with a good tradesecreted model to provide the Bush administration and the American people and America's allies better humanitarian and ethical safeguards, better public acceptance, better public appreciation and better implementation than evidenced by the languishing years of the prior administration's fiddling.

Please allow me to help in response to your assessment, Mr. President, that.."..The United States has a critical need for cutting-edge technology that can quickly and effectively detect, analyze, facilitate interdiction of, defend against, defeat, and mitigate the consequences of WMD (weapons of mass destruction)..." The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Defense System, properly implemented will help you do that better than otherwise possible giving you more time to breath, as did the Integrated Approach for the New York Times I presented resulted in a milestone for the world's greatest newspaper in the management of electronic news records.

With references from John McCarthy, Jr. Esq., of Littler Mendelson and Dr. Nancy Miller, here in Jerusalem, former contract acquisitions manager for The United States Air Force. 

Marc, also, relevant our last conversation and update re the $300 Million Dollar Government announcement and the immediately following $1.2 million CDC Harvard announcement, below is a cut and paste of an 
e-mail to someone pasted here for your information.

" I believe current events have caused US Governmental authorities to 1) validate the Biowar Interactive Early Warning System and 2) place a significant 
price upon its implementation. The opportunity is capable of much stronger presentation than this e-mail allows.

     This is believed to be the case due to 1) my prior tradesecreted and proprietized proposals, and 2) current competing actions by two (2) of the government authorities utilizing the tradesecreted proprietary intellectual property:

     1) I made documented trade secreted, proprietary, confidential and copywrited proposals:

     a) forecasting the likelihood of sneak anthrax and
chemical/biological and other attacks against    American citizens and interests, 

     b) proposing as a defense and deterrent the "The BioWar Internet Interactive Early Warning and Defense System Module of the Confidential Computer Patient Record" in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 to several potential customers/clients, including, without limitation, key portions of the United States
Government....

   ....The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) March 31, 1997 - A White Paper for the BioWar Early Warning System  to Larry DeBois and the  Director of The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) detailing the likelihood of chem/bio attacks, including anthrax and the benefits of the system as a deterrent and life saving device;

   ....1997, 1998, 1999 Mark Weisman (spelling ?), Contract Director, Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Center For Disease Control (CDC) Dr. Koplan's (spelling?) Office under HHS; Parenthetically, Dr. Krakauer, after writing
the recommendation of my firm for the Computer Patient Record, was promoted to Policy Advisor to the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services; and,

   ....1999, and 2000 and 2001, Office of The Secretary of Defense to DoD Chemical and Biological Defense and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)  Acting Director Walling to Anna Johnson-Winegar, Ph.D., Office of the Assistant To The Secretary of Defense, Nuclear and Chemical And Biological
Defense Programs, Deputy for Chemical/Biological Defense.

None acted. Johnson-Winegar did not respond in writing to the 1999 proposal in which others in DoD said it was badly needed in Kuwait and Egypt, for starters, but only after a diligent Col. Walling wrote in a November, 2001 letter of acknowledgement, did she acknowledge the 2001 proposal in a letter dated Jan 4, 2002, saying "Thank you for the White Paper on 'Biowar Internet Interactive Early Warning and Defense System Module of the Confidential Computer Patient Record", 
wanting more details of the workings of the system; however, sufficient had been given for them to begin with a first ever effort beginning as early as 1997.


     2)Now after sever criticism following September 11, 2001, on August 27, 2002, Pamela Hess UPI Pentagon Correspondent in a UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL (you may wish to see it by downloading it from UPI's site: A:\United Press International DC to get bio-attack warning system.htm) Press Release entitled:

"DC to get bio-attack warning system" reports 

"-- Washington, Albuquerque, N.M., and two other cities will get an experimental "medical surveillance system" this fall and winter to track diseases in hopes of identifying a biological attack before 
it reaches epidemic proportions, Pentagon officials told United Press International Tuesday."

"The $300 million, two-year pilot program is sponsored by the Defense Department"


and quotes  Ph.D Winegar as saying...... 

"We all recognize this is something we need to do....it has been less than robustly supported. It; a matter of competing priorities. A lot of people had put a biological terrorist attack in the hypothetical 
category until last fall. Shame on us."

Indeed. And, for more than one reason.


Shortly after this report, it was reported that CDC, also severely criticized for not being prepared, has (see the Boston Globe, within the last several weeks days: US PLANS A SYSTEM TO DETECT BIOATTACK
Published on October 3, 2002. Author(s):    Stephen Smith, Globe Staff) granted $1.2 Million to a Harvard medical team for a similar project. CDC had negotiated over and received the trade secreted materials and proposals in 1997-1998, and more.


My point, here, in all humility, is not to now push for a controversy resolution with these two groups, but to submit the following observation and activity:

1. Observation. The proposal and its seminal proprietary and trade secreted idea has been recognized and acted upon (with "shameful"
taint, admittedly) by two (2) of the several contracting authorities receiving validating its worth as an over-due expenditure of $300,000,000.00 US Dollars for 4 US Cities. Over 1000 US Cities of significant size and more are vulnerable, not to
mention the world market, on a year by year, day by day, basis;

2. Observation. They have, in my humble opinion, at least three (3) potentially significant deficiencies  which we may be able to help everybody overcome:

   (i). It appears the allegations of violation of rights of privacy by certain media and the related constitutional rights of US citizens may have more considerations necessary for the administration to be comfortable and that our system would ameliorate that to the administration's benefit. Our system does that in a, in my humble opinion, most desirable way; and,

(ii). Their methods of (a) implementation, (b) doctor acceptance, and (c) analysis, as well as (d) systemic composition are potientially flawed and leave unnecessary room for others to criticize the administration, when, in fact if presented properly the administration would have positive public relations with the same effect and avoid the insufficiencies as to the (a), (b), and (c) aspects and avoid sending civil rights groups up the wall as to the (d)aspect, in my humble opinion.

3. Submitted activity. A contract to provide our system to say, The State of Florida, Univ of Fla, possibly, New York (and, perhaps others, The State of Texas, California, etc., for openers)with all the safeguards, economic benefits to those States and their citizenry, universities and doctors 
and health care professionals,  would permit us to activate the desirable alternative and then speak with our rivals concerning proper and beneficial roles in a consortium.

Time of course is of the essence. Of course there are several items best for direct discussion, including research on specific contact points to implement, in all humility, the proprietary first-class complete system addressing concerns of the largest population groups.

CDC Harvard $1.2 Million/ Page A 1 Boston Globe 10/3/2002 by Stephen Smith at the Boston Globe. 

US Plans a system to detect bioattack.

"The CDC is committing $ 1.2 Million to the trial of the computerized surveilance network....The technological proof-of-concept is recommended by Dr. Nancy Miller, former USAF Program Acquisition Manager and scientist, along with other top experts as real, now.

Please put me in contact with the necessary parties and advise what I may do to clarify any necessary matters and make any necessary adjustments that will facilitate our proposal meeting with success.

Benefits to the  Clients and Others.

1.	How many people in the USA would benefit from the project? 

2.	The entire United States population of approximately two hundred eighty million persons (280,000,000) would ALL potentially benefit 
from the Clearinghouse projects of the Biowar Early Warning System, The Computer Patient Record Management System, The Media Risk Management System and the Monetary Risk Management System.

3.	What are the potential benefits to the State of Florida, New York, others and their citizens and Associates? 

4.	Potentially,..Unlimited...Becoming the global leader in bringing dignity and integrity in Humanitarian Medical, Media and Monetary Risk and Flex-management, including, without limitation, anti-terrorism and electronic information management. Potentially the $250 Billion Dollar US Domestic Market will yield 25 Billion Dollars to Florida, New York 
in gross revenue cash flow for each ten percent (10%) market share of the US Doctor's Paper-less Office Market, (the most stable and inelastic segment of the US economy), not to mention the balance of the global market and the remaining elements of the Clearinghouse. 

As mentioned, there are numerous recommendations and references, including, without limitation, Dr. Nancy Miller, former United States Air Force Project Acquisition Manager whom, among her many achievements, performed dual use (commercial/governmental) activities with the US Government and M. D. Anderson.   Dr. Miller's recommendation is to be found 
on the "Angelfire" web-site set-out, below.

We would utilize the same tried and true Integrated Approach Technology business model I developed for use at the New York Times utilizing an Integration Agreement to bring together the necessary 
capabilities for successful completion of a very simple proof-of-concept, implement it and make it available, globally.   At the New York Times, this was accomplished by converting a New York Times printing 
press into a "new" press, and then implementing the process throughout the press line, making it available globally, this resulting in modernizing the New York Times (successfully competing against the world's largest merchant banks) and successfully launching and completing the Initial Public Offering on Wall Street of the integration company I formed which was taken public by Bear Stearns. There it was the management of electronic news records. Here, it is the management 
of electronic medical records and I am respectfully asking your help to launch the activity with you and New York State, implement it and make it available, globally. That means an Integration Agreement 
to bring together the capabilities (you and New York State, et. al.) necessary to complete the simple 
proof-of-concept which we know to be eminently doable with existing technologies, and then implement it, making it available globally.

     The activities now available would include a BioWar Interactive Medical, Media and Monetary Risk Management Clearinghouse beginning with the defense of Anthrax and Germ/Chem warfare, together with the $250 Billion Dollar US Doctor's Paper-less Office Market made available globally, to defend the USA and its allies, Israel, and others. Hebrew University and associated hospitals and others, here, in Israel and elsewhere, would be available to join Florida, New York along with other great states and universities. These activities would benefit every man, woman 
and child in American - all 280 million souls.

                           
                      Very respectfully,

Subject:	Beach Patrol and EMS/Ocean Lifeguard Curriculum at PJC

They say "Slow wheels grind fine" . . . although I am slow, I AM persistent.
 
The purpose of this email is to introduce those who share interest in this cause to each other, and distribute the email addresses of those dedicated persons who have the vision to see the need for an EMS Based Beach Patrol, A Beach Patrol that is a 501-C3 (Non-Profit) that can receive funding from both public and private sources (in cash and in-kind), A Beach Patrol that can serve both public and private beaches without burdening local government, and A Beach Patrol that is driven by Mission, not by politics.  Also, a Beach Patrol that is "fed" quality people by a Junior College curriculum similar to one the USLA certifies at Miramar College in California http://www.miramar.sdccd.cc.ca.us/ , but with the added aspect of Paramedic Certification to produce a true EMS Certified Paramedic/Ocean Lifeguard.  Chris Brewster bcb@compuserve.com , National Certification Officer,  during his visit to Pensacola http://www.wear3.com/news/Stories/august/0821/lifesaverspbeach.htm (and) http://www.pbrla.com/news_08302a.html has already offered to arrange the liaisons with Miramar for Sandra Hartley who heads the Paramedic Program at Pensacola Junior College.
 
The interest in such an educational program is very high on a state, national and international basis.  We have ALL of the elements here in Pensacola to launch such a curriculum.  I will support this effort with time, voice, and money; any time, any where.  
 
I am pleased to announce that the Santa Rosa Island Beach Patrol, Inc. has been incorporated as a Florida not-for-profit corporation.  I am now working with my CPA and attorney to structure the budget, Federal Non-Profit status, By-Laws, Board of Directors, etc.  I would like to ask you to support me in this great step and huge effort necessary to create this vehicle.
 
It is not my intention to confront the Santa Rosa Island Authority(!) over jurisdiction over the beach.  They are only able to provide coverage over a very small portion of the beach as it is, and no plans or method of which I am aware, to extend protection to the hotels and condo's or private property.  
 
I expect 1 to 3 years of organizational and preparatory work before the SRIBP will be in a position to assume responsibilities.  I do believe that there will be a NEED by hotels and condo's on the island for Beach Protection services by that time, if not before.  My desire is to make very sure that things are done correctly, accurately, and are well planned and organized to continue in perpetuity guaranteed by an endowment.  I submit that there will be beaches and people who both will need protecting long after all of us are gone.  The organization of the SRIBP will provide a vehicle to take beach safety into the future in ways not now envisioned or currently practiced.  A Public/Private Consortium is the best vehicle.  Such PPC's are being used in Canada for SAR and Beach Safety.  The PPC offers the ability to accept both public and private funding, and serve both public and private beaches under both public and private contracts.
 
I encourage each of you to stay in touch with me and each other.  Ask of me anything, if it will contribute to making our beaches more safe.  I thank you for all of your encouragement and support.
 
I remain,
My Son's Proud Father -

Dear Governor,

I think you mean that you "don't agree" with my Dad.  Whatever you mean I respect your 1st amendment right and I respect your leadership.  However, in perilous times you merit vigilance then why do you refuse to help my child?  If Dr. Haney were to examine the state of "peril" he might, much like the international press, state that you are exaggerating and suffering from Munchhausen by proxy.  Thank God we both know Dr. Haney is inaccurate.  

It would seem that we should take care of each other before we embark on a war.  Hungry soldiers do not fight well, they just desert well.

The point of the e-mail is that I was home taking care of my son and I was not at a rally.  Despite the headlines in about 15 international papers I have not spread the news of our "arrogant" international reputation.  I just take care of my son and attempt to access services for him; just a Mom not a radical.  Conversely, the conduct of some of your administration is and will remain quite alarming.  All families and children should be able to protect themselves from reasonable harm including Dr. Haney.  A lot of state employees got nice fat pay stubs to deny my child services and I do not think that is what you want.  Dr. Haney is your problem as he is every Floridians' problem.  Our family sincerely does not want to fight this out we just need for our child to get the services without all the hassles.  Respectfully we request that my entire record be cleared as the accusation of abuse was retaliatory and will prevent me from working within my chosen field of special education.  I worked very hard for my Master's Degree and the abuse charge renders it absolutely useless.  I hope you read Olmstead v. L.C.

Olmstead makes some very good points that are relevant to this case.  One more thing while I have you, could you please instruct your employees to sign their own names, use their own letter heads, quit blaming each other, stop forging parents names, and actual do their jobs.  Four years ago I would have thought this a foregone conclusion but today I think you need to remind state employees to act with integrity and inaccordance with their job descriptions.  It would seem state employees lack the knowledge to adequately perform their jobs.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Elizabeth Siebert MS

I overheard aconversation while shopping in a dept store that really up set me. Two women were talking about DCF and it seems this one woman has a eight yr old girl and a six year old boy-parents are divorced,father has the boy-mother has the girl well it seems the boy told his father that their mother and step father punish them by using a BELT and when the father approached his ex-wife about this, she said that the case worker explained it was all right to spank with a belt or any item that does not leave brueses. I have had a great concerne for the dept of DCF ever sence my wife and I were told that if we get aa DIVORCE they could help my wife with medicade. When you hired this new chief of DCF I wrote you my concernes, now I am really wondering if I should approach the media or some other agency I can trust. You have always been good about answering my mail and I hope you still will. Thank you for listening. --

Subject: Change Management


Dear Governor Bush:
 
I met you last week at the IT Florida reception held at the Governor’s Mansion.  I am Vice President of the Central Florida Chapter of the Society for Information Management (SIM) and mentioned that we would be sending you an invitation to provide an opening address at our 2nd annual CIO Summit in December, 2003 to be held in Orlando.  That invitation will be sent to you shortly.
 
I am also President of Stratner Company, a professional services firm focused on improving the business value of technology.  In your comments at the reception, you mentioned that you were going to hire a “change manager” to help lead your efforts to transform state government to operate in a more business manner.  I may be able to help you.
 
Throughout my career of some thirty-five years, I have guided organizations, both large and small, in changing and improving their business practices.  Some examples include:
*         Implementation of formal project management methods for a major New England bank (historically, banks had not managed projects).
*         Design and implementation of product management practices to create “general managers of a product business.”
*         Implementation of project management methods for a large insurance company.
*         Management of global business practices for a mid-sized telecommunications company.
*         Creation of “business-savvy” engineers for a large, global computer systems company.
*         Formal study of “The Management of Worldwide Strategic Alliances” as part of a graduate program at INSEAD, a leading business school in Fontainebleau, France.
 
My career includes executive positions in business unit general management, IT management and business infrastructure.  I currently offer a seminar that teaches IT managers how to be “general managers of an IT business,” along with a similar program for product managers.  The seminars focus on the importance of communication and managing stakeholder expectations, in addition to explaining the business and product life cycles and how to define markets (both for externally-focused products and for internally-focused services).  Additional information is available at my website, www.stratner.biz.
 
Beyond what I can imply from your comments at the reception, I am not sure exactly how you plan to proceed.  However, if you might be interested in further discussions, I would be happy to speak with you or a member of your staff at your convenience.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
 
Sincerely,
 
Dave Rasmussen

Hello, I just came across this site by accident, looking for something else.  I was very much  surprised that there was a Citizens Corp organized in Florida.  No one has ever contacted us. We have the oldest (27 years) and largest over (800,000 residents) involved in Neighborhood Watch programs. We also implement Youth Crime Watch of Miami-Dade programs in all the schools, funded by MiamiDade School Board. We are a 501c3 nonprofit, funded by MiamiDade County, we are housed in one of the Miami Dade Police building and work with all the Municipalities (30). We also have an Early Start program, funded by the Governors Drug Control Office.  I did notice that Miami-Dade is listed as a Citizens Corp Council and the contact is thru the County Emergency Management. Obviously, there is a lack of communication, for we have never been invited to participate as a component. I would like our organization to be considered and would like to be listed. Please advise as to whom I must contact.
Sincerely,

Subject:	Teaching The Truth

Dear Governor Bush,

     Congratulations on your victory last November!  

     I teach Political Science at Valencia Community College-East Campus in Orlando, Fla. In addition to my U.S. Government classes, I have designed and am currently teaching a State & Local Government class this semester. My students are quite impressed with your leadership and quite frankly, so am I. I would like to extend an invitation to you to visit my State & Local class (Tuesday/Thursday 11:30am-12:45pm) and discuss the successes and the challenges we continue to face in the State of Florida.

     On a different note, I have been quite concerned that your brother has not been treated fairly in the press or by certain members of Congress as it relates to the case that has been built against Iraq. That is why I have shown all of my classes the unedited, 31-minute speech President Bush made in Cincinnati spelling out, in detail, the case against Saddam. I must tell you that the response has been overwhelming. At least 75% of the students said they did not understand what Iraq was all about until they saw President Bush's speech in my class. Even some of those who oppose war admitted that President Bush made his case to the people. Many students thanked me for showing that speech. Out of 235 students, only a modest 30 said they did not believe President Bush made his case. Two of my classes are Dual Enrollment classes at Colonial High School. Those high school students thanked me for showing the video because they had heard Iraq was a "personal thing for Bush's father". That amazed me. 

     I believe in teaching the truth. When my classes last semester discussed your race, it was on a fact-based playing field. They were instructed to watch, or in one case hear, the debates. In each class, even Democrats said that you had a better vision for Florida. I did radio analysis in October and called the race in your favor by a landslide. Some listeners remembered that on election night and reminded me of my prediction. Thank you for making that prediction hold true!

     Please let me know if you are able to speak to my class. I know you have a very busy schedule. I anxiously await your reply.

Governor Bush,

On behalf of the Central Florida YMCA and the Southwest Orlando Jaycees, I
would like to thank you for sending Rebecca Mattingly to represent you at
our annual Prayer Breakfast.  Her speech was phenomenal and was much needed
as it helped to set a tone of reflection and inspiration.  I look forward to
maintaining a relationship with Ms. Mattingly as she is a wonderful lady
with a dynamic spirit.

During the Prayer Breakfast, our public policy person, Wayne Humphrey,
extended and invitation to you and Ms. Mattingly to tour one of the best
kept secrets in Central Florida - the Lake Nona YMCA.

Governor Bush, simply put, every kid deserves a Lake Nona YMCA.  Within that
facility you have an A+ elementary school, NorthLake Park Elementary School,
and a community center, the YMCA.  But more importantly, you have a sharing
of resources that has manifested into kids excelling in school and their
families developing much needed bonds with teachers and school
administrators that extend well past the normal school day.  This project
has even won an Urban Land Institute Award for creative land usage.
Attached you will find an article that further details the impact the school
is making on our community.

Again, thank you Governor Bush for supporting the Arthur "Pappy" Kennedy
Prayer Breakfast.

Subject:	Medicaid Waiver Projects

Importance:	High

Dear Governor:

 

As I promised at the CABA banquet, I am writing to you on a very important matter. I have been working with housing for the elderly for about eight years and in particular Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) in public housing. You visited Helen Sawyer Plaza, a pilot project nationally recognized because it was the first in the nation. ALFs save the government money because they divert elderly residents who qualify for Medicaid and would otherwise be in a nursing home, to the much more economical assisted living facility.

 

ALFs in public housing need Medicaid Waivers to survive. Three housing authorities have gone out on a limb and are converting, acquiring or constructing ALFs on the expectation that they would receive these waivers. Your Department of Elder Affairs supported a line item proviso in this fiscal year’s appropriation to include the DOEA’s ability to contract directly with housing authorities in Tampa, Pinellas County and Titusville for Medicaid Waiver funds. Additionally, the  “Coming Home Grant” sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation works with housing authorities and demonstration projects to meet the goals of the grant, which include project basing Medicaid Waivers. This State grant is in peril without demonstration projects. Secretary White assured these housing authorities that they could proceed with their conversions and the Medicaid waivers would be issued during this fiscal year. Well, the fiscal year is more than half over and the waivers are still tied up in bureaucratic quagmire.

 

These housing projects are not only good for the residents of the State, but they have given Florida national recognition. Besides Helen Sawyer Plaza’s recognition, one of these new projects was written up in the National Academy’s State Health Policy’s recent book on Assisted Living.  Thus, Florida is receiving national attention for this creative way to combine Medicaid and HUD dollars to increase funding for nursing home diversion without any increase in the State’s share of the cost. You can find a more detailed description of the demonstration at http://www.nashp.org/Files/Fl.pdf. 

 

Governor, I need your help with the bureaucrats in Tallahassee or housing authorities will never take a chance in the future on any of these projects. Additionally, we stand to lose the Foundation’s matching funds and all the national recognition as an innovator in this important area of meeting the needs of our elderly. Please contact the DOEA and give them a little push in breaking this logjam.\

 

Please say hello to Columba. I miss seeing her at Jazzercize, but I’ve been too busy with these projects to work out. My husband the judge says hello, too.

Importance:	High

Dear Commissioner Durden:  

I understand that you are among  the Transportation Commissioners who will be interviewing the candidates for your new executive director.  I apologize for the lateness in contacting you, however, I have been out of town just learned of your interview schedule.

Sally Patrenos should, without question, be your next executive director for the Florida Transportation Commission.  

I have had the privilege of knowing and working with Sally since 1978 on a diverse array of issues facing our state and can unequivocally say that she is one of the most professional and outstanding managers with whom I have ever worked.

The Florida Transportation Commission was created while I was in the Florida House of Representatives, where I served as a Republican Floor Leader and a member of the House Transportation Committee. It takes a strong and effective executive director as well as Commission to achieve the mission of providing leadership in meeting the goals of the Legislature and of Florida's transportation needs.  No matter how vital a governing body, it can only move forward as well as its staff.

You already know Sally's abilities.  She possesses the traits that are vital to being a servant of the people and to being the strong and effective director which you and your fellow Commissioners demand.  Sally has professional integrity.  She is one of the most effective consensus builders I have ever known.  She is articulate, extremely knowledgeable and effective in the legislative arena. Sally successfully tackles and resolves complex issues, and then boils them down to understandable language.

Although Brevard County is now my home, my family is from the Panhandle. Sally has vision, she sees and cares about all of our State, not just one region.  She understands the diversity of Florida, and the challenges and opportunities which come with our State's diversity.

I am now with one of our State's seaports, Port Canaveral, and know how important it is for the Florida Transportation Commission and the Department of Transportation to understand the operations and needs of Florida's 14 deepwater seaports; of how our seaports mesh in the overall transportation goals for Florida, whether moving people or moving cargo, and whether moving it by rail, road, sea, or air.  Without a  full understanding of how all modes of transportation interact, our State cannot move forward or be competitive.

Sally has the vision you need in your executive director.  She has the strength to move forward the goals and mission of the Florida Transportation Commission.  She knows how to work successfully with leaders, as well as with staff and  constituents -- constituents we all serve, as they are the residents of our state.

Please, do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any other information in support of Sally as your next executive director for the Florida Transportation Commission. You can find no one better for the position or the task ahead.

Sincerely,

Dixie Sansom

Dear President and Governor Bush:
Our health care in our country is a huge disgrace. My grandson is 7yrs
old 
and has a severe care of asthma, he has been taken by ambulance to the 
hospital in Daytona twice in 3 days , the hospitals do nothing for this 
child except ask if his mom has upset him to make him have this attack.
First of all my daughter is a wonderful Mother( a single parent) and her

world revolves around Austin ( her son ) what does it take to get a
child 
admitted into a hospital and get the proper care before that something 
happens real bad????

I remember when my children were growing up the first concern was always
the 
childs health never a question the Doctors could do there job and care
for 
them in the matter that each one should be cared for . My grandson is a
"A" 
student in advanced classes, his mother has worked very hard with him
ever 
since he was born. Mr. Governor you sent him a signed photo of yourself
and 
a nice note saying how happy you were that he is doing so very well in 
school , this little boy has not been in school since before christmas
due 
to him being sick there must be something you gentleman can do to help
my 
daughter get something done.
If you need any information you can call me at 727-547-0043 my name is 
Dottie Seubert. sirs I love my grandson very much and am a very very 
concerned grandparent.

Austin's medical file is like a book it is that thick, his Dr here is 
wonderful and if Austin were here on my coast he would have already been

taken care of . Please sir's from a grand parents point of view we need
your 
help to get this child taken care of properly


Thank you for your help
God bless
Dottie Seubert

Governor Bush,
Since Dr. Edwin Roberts was a board member of the Coastal Conservation Association of Florida who brought the action to request downlisting, should he recuse himself as chair of the Fish and Wildlife Commission on this important decision.
 
The CCA agenda to support the narrowly defined interest of its angler membership should not take precedence over the continued protection of this important species for the Florida economy and ecology. Apparently disagreement exists as to the actual counts. If so, the first priority should be to get counts that are unbiased and accurate.

Jim,

This article captures the crux of the matter and no one is blowing smoke this time.  Do you want to deprive the people of Florida access to care to "be fair" to the plaintiff's attorney's?

Your argument about "punishing" those doctors guilty of egregious errrors is wrong.  They aren't the ones paying the price for those errors via their malpractice premiums.  It's guys like me who pay the price of their punishment in my skyrocketing premiums.  And it's why I've quit doing ER and inpatient surgieries.

Come on.  We're counting on you to take the heat.

Jeb

You will be making a decision soon on the future of the Southeast Volusia County Hospital Taxing District Board appointments. I think your choices are clear:

1.  Accept the recommendations of Charlie Hilton, Tom Feeney, the entire Oak Hill City Council, officials from New Smyrna Beach, over 20+ local doctors and, most importantly, 1,000+ petition signing voters, to appoint people who support the right of the taxpaying voters to decide the future of their hospital, or

2. Accept the recommendations of hospital administrators and their supporters to maintain the status quo.

If you support a vote of the people to decide the future of Bert Fish, you will likely receive several bonuses:  Our taxing unit could be an incubator for: 1. medical savings accounts, 2. privatization (Note: with voter approval) , 3. voter participation and 4. "Consumer Choice" medical malpractice tort reform (Note: James Madison Institute has offered to help)

If you decide to meet personally with any of the parties interested with your appointments, we would be open to presenting our "Voter Control" option personally.

Dearest Jeb,

It seems like such a long time since we have seen or spoken to each other although I am pleased that you have kept in close contact with Syl.  He so treasures the long friendship you have had. 

Let me begin by saying that you and your family have been in our thoughts and prayers regarding Noelle's situation.  You know that I know better than most what she is going through and I pray that she will be successful in her fight against her substance abuse.  You know that you can count on me should she need someone to lean on.  It seems that a very strange bond is formed by those who suffer similar circumstances and this is no exception.  Columba and you have dedicated your lives to being good parents and the suffering you have endured is almost unimaginable.  It is safe to assume that she will emerge a new and very different but wiser person.

You may know that President Clinton commuted my sentence two years ago and since then I have dedicated most of my free time to prison reform issues.  I served time with many women, much like Noelle, who became victims of substance abuse and the related problems that accompany this big evil.  Why, 90 percent of the women with whom I served were in prison for drug conspiracy crimes.  

It is in that vain that I write this email.  I am a member of the Junior League and I am Chair-Elect of the Girls Advocacy Project (GAP) Committee.  The GAP Program is a program developed by Miami-Dade Juvenile Court Judge Cindy Lederman to give female youth offenders an opportunity to change their lives through the association with community based organizations who can offer services to these troubled young ladies.  I was also honored when I was invited to serve on the board of another organization called ArtSpring that brings an arts based curicculum into the women's state prison as well as the GAP Program.  We operate in every Florida facility with the exception of Lowell and Gadsden.  

The organization enjoyed a good relationship with Rini Bartlett who oversaw the women's prisons before recently retiring.   Our program has been successful at improving an inmate's behavior and self esteem creating an environment that makes the inmate a more positive addition to the general inmate population as well as creating the tools they need as they integrate back into society. 

I read with great interest that you had appointed Secretary Crosby and hope that he will bring about positive reforms to the Department of Corrections.  I am writing you to see if you could put me in touch with him or the new person who will be overseeing the women's prisons.  I think it is important for us to maintain a good working relationship with the prison administration at each of the facilities and this can be accomplished easiest if we have the support from the top ranks.  Please let me know what you would suggest as the best possible avenue for us.  

On a personal note, I want you to know how much I have appreciated your support over the years.  Syl and I learned quickly who our friends are and knew that we could always count on you.  It wasn't easy to live through such an injustice but God knew exactly what he was doing as He provided an opportunity to once again help those less fortunate.  I consider it such a blessing.  Thanks for everything and we hope to see you soon.  Much love, Vicki

Subject:	Hello

Hi Jeb,
       Congratulations on your appointment of Cynthia Imperato to the bench in Broward.  Cindy is my friend and neighbor, and she will make a fine judge and will not disappoint or embarrass you.
       I know this is not a fun time for you, as you roll out your proposed budget.  Although, I am not longer in the legislature my phones have been ringing off the hook today.  Of particular concern is the absence of funding for the PACE Program.
       In 1990, I first brought the concept from Jacksonville to Ft. Lauderdale.  There were no programs strictly for girls in the county.  The program has grown to be the most successful program in the whole Juvenile Justice System.  The state wanted us to create a prevention program for girls, and we did, and are now #1 in Florida.
       We have graduated over 500 girls in Broward alone since we started the program.  Each of our girls goes on to the Junior College, a college, vocational, or tech school.  This far outpaces the public school system in success.  The Broward County School Board had been holding back 22% or 23% of the school funding that is supposed to follow each student...under the guise of "administrative costs," which is a joke.  Our staff at the Pace Center for Girls does all the paperwork, turns it over to the Area Director, who in turn files it with Tallahassee.
       Jeb, I know you have extremely difficult choices to make it each category of the budget.  As a former HHS Budget chairman, I had many times when I had to make excruciating cuts, and I do understand, probably better than most, your thought process at this juncture. 
       The Class Size Amendment is over shadowing the state budget, but it is my understanding that it doesn't have to be fully implemented until 2010.  There are other ways of addressing the class reduction teacher/pupil ratio issue without building new schools.  The James Madison Institute produced a paper last month with excellent suggestions regarding the issue. 
       The implementing language has not yet been passed. There is still time to redirect our limited educational resources toward paying good teachers a higher salary to teach longer days, and putting more teacher aides in the classroom.  Thereby, reducing the ratio rather than putting untold dollars into the big black hole of bricks and mortar for new schools.  We are not fully utilizing the physical plants that exist in our school inventories today.
       I have long felt that MSA's (Medical Savings Accounts) would provide a far more reliable and predictable insurance budget  than the use it or lose it indemnity policies of Blue/Cross Blue/ Shield for our state employees.  At the very least, it should be offered as an option.     The money rolls over year after year, and places the onus on the individual to take better care of himself or herself.  By choosing to stop smoking, exercise, make better choices in lifestyle, the financial benefit and savings enures to them.  There is a catastrophic policy raped inside the account, in the event it should become necessary to use it. 
       If this account were to say cost $3,000 per worker per year, the state could choose to pick up all or match a portion of the cost.  It could conceivably allow the state to offer a shared cost healthcare MSA to our OPS personnel, who presently receive no health options.  
       We are faced every year with the unpredictable increases from BC/BS.  It affects the budget enormously, and it is strangling us.
       I wish today, that I had the option to have had an MSA 20 years ago, when I was first elected to office.  I would gladly have shared in the cost each year, knowing I could choose my own doctors, pay for health needs not traditionally covered in our usual policies, and that I would be financially rewarded for taking personal responsibility for my health needs.  I practically never used the BC/BS policy, as the few doctors I would want to use were not included in the PPO.  The state taxpayers expended over $6,000 for my coverage last year!
       Predicability in a budget item of this magnitude is long overdue.  Please ask Donna what the total cost of the state personnel's insurance program amounts to in the current budget year. 
       Just a few of my thoughts for you to ponder.
                                                  With warm regards , Debby

Shalom dear friends,

If you are fed up with Federal, State, and Local "fat cat" SELF SERVANTS instead of PUBLIC SERVANTS as we should have e mail this to as many of your e mail list as possibe. This issue must become front and central in all elections in 2003 and 2004. If the PEOPLE WILL LEAD THE LEADERS WILL FOLLOW. You have not because you do not speak out.

If United Airlines can ask its employees to take a one third cut in their salaries, then in an effort order to turn our economy around, let's cut Federal State and Local salaries and perks of our so called "servants" by 33%.

A friend who retired from Sears told me yesterday that she lost 50% value of her   stocks which  are tied to her retirementr social security must be fixed and the unjust retire fund for alll Senators and Congressmen must end prompluy or DO NOT VOTE TO  REELECT THEM.

(The Social Security Solution)

This must be a campaign issue in 2004. Keep it going.

SOCIAL SECURITY: (This is worth the read. It's short and to the point.)

Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions during election years. Our Senators and Congressmen do not pay into Social Security. Many years ago they voted in their own benefit plan. In more recent years, no congress person has felt the need to change it. For all practical purposes their plan works like this: 

When they retire, they continue to draw the same
pay until they die, except it may increase from time to time for cost of living adjustments. For example, former Senator Byrd and Congressman White and
their wives may expect to draw $7,800,000 -- that's Seven Million, Eight Hundred Thousand), with their wives drawing $275,000.00 during the last years of their lives. This is calculated on an average life span for each.

Their cost for this excellent plan is $00.00. This little perk they voted for themselves is free to them. You and I pick up the tab for this plan. The funds for this fine retirement plan come directly from the General Fund--our tax dollars at work! From our own Social Security Plan, which you and I pay (or have paid) into -- every payday until we retire (which amount is matched by our employer) --we can expect to get an average $1,000 per month after retirement. Or, in other words, we would have to collect our average of $1,000 monthly benefits for 68 years and one month to equal Senator Bill Bradley's benefits!

Social Security could be very good if only one small change were made. And that change would be to jerk the Golden Fleece Retirement Plan from under
the Senators and Congressmen. Put them into the Social Security plan with the rest of us and then watch how fast they would fix it.

If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of
awareness will be planted and maybe good changes will evolve. WE, each one of us, can make a
difference.

How many people can YOU send this to?

A Times Editorial

Bush's shaky budget

The governor's budget is rife with counterproductive ''savings'' and tax relief for investors, selling Floridians short. 


(c) St. Petersburg Times
published January 23, 2003 

"Take that! And that! And that! . . ." 

He didn't phrase it quite that baldly, of course. But as Gov. Jeb Bush announced his budget Tuesday, it sounded as if he was punishing Floridians for ratifying the class size initiative that he opposed. 

The most pointed cut, an $111-million blow to the universities, took dead aim at the one constituency -- families keen on education -- that was most concerned with the passage of Amendment 9. That's $111-million less for operations even with the 7.5 percent mandatory tuition increase built into his budget. Community colleges, meanwhile, would get less than they need just for enrollment growth. Construction of some of the new public school classrooms would be funded with bond money diverted from the universities. 

The next logical step would be to zero-fund the state's industrial development budget. High technology employers expect and demand a highly educated work force. Florida, which already ranks last in spending per capita on higher education, cannot afford the governor's false economy. 

There are other counterproductive "savings" in the Bush budget. To spend less on preventing juvenile crime means costlier prisons in the near future. To cut public transit subsidies for the sake of laying down more concrete is to get the least mileage for the money. No pay raise, but higher insurance premiums, for state employees is a undeserved blow to their morale. Limiting the medically needy program to prescription drugs raises the questions of who will pay the doctors who prescribe those drugs and what will happen to seriously ill clients who need hospital care as well. 

Bush sought to blame most of this on Amendment 9, saying the people made it "their number one priority." But the budget in fact serves primarily his priorities: less government, fewer taxes. 

But not so neatly as he makes it seem. The $64-million that he'd make the counties pay to detain juveniles until their hearings is a potential increase in local property taxes. So is much of the additional $417-million earmarked to the schools from increases in the taxable value of real estate. 

The juvenile detention cost shift is wrong in every respect. It needs to remain a state responsibility for the reason that it became one in the first place: to guarantee a uniform standard of care regardless of where children at risk happen to live. Nobody ever questioned this priority until Jeb Bush came along. 

The most problematic area of his budget is the notion of a wholesale conversion of trust funds to general revenue. Quite possibly, some funds have outlasted the purposes for which they are earmarked, but no one could seriously say that's true of the affordable housing and environmental land purchase bonds that are underwritten by trust funds from documentary stamps, to name just two examples. To that extent, the governor is balancing his budget on some very shaky assumptions. 

Amid so much hardship and damage, Bush would press ahead insensibly with the intangibles tax cut that was delayed on account of the economic aftershocks of Sept. 11, 2001. That reduction, now effective with the tax payments due in January 2004, would cost some $116-million. Coincidentally, that just about matches the proposed cut to the universities. 

The Legislature should either repeal that tax cut or change it to exempt the same number of smaller taxpayers but double the rate on those remaining. 

Republican governors in Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky and several other states are calling for tax increases to mitigate severe budget cuts that have been forced on them, as on Florida, by the stagnant economy. Nevada's Kenny Guinn is asking for nearly $1-billion, without which, he said Monday, service cuts in health and education would "produce a devastating effect on every single Nevadan." Such an outcome, he said, "is not a choice for leaders, but a choice of political cowardice." 

It sells the people of Florida short to propose on their behalf a budget that imposes so many hardships at the same time it grants tax relief to investors. The Senate, to its credit, intends to hold extensive public hearings on the budget and is willing to entertain tax reforms that could make a more decent thing of it. Unfortunately, neither the governor nor the House seems disposed at this point to listen to reason. But so long as there is life, there is hope.

Good morning, Governor. 

While in Miami last weekend I saw a friend of mine who is a teacher.
Actually, he directs the Dade County Public School's International
Baccelauriate Program. He had lots of ideas on how to improve the A+ Program
and pointed out some of the major glitches in its  current implemnation. 

When I urged him to share his ideas in Tallahasse his response was: "they
don't care what those of us in the trenches -- we who can help them --
really think. Not even Jeb. "

I assured him that he was wrong about "Jeb" and that you care deeply about
improving education for all our children. I promissed to connect you two by
e-mail so that you could at least hear him out. 

His name in John Lamb. His e-mail is: jlamb7@bellsouth.net 

I hope you take a moment to reach out to him. 

As always, I am your man.

Hi-
I'm glad you are there to lead the state through such a tough budget.  It looks like you made some tough decisions and you did a good job.  I know you don't want to see taxes increased or an increase in gambling and I agree with you although I realize that tax increases might be needed, I worry about how that will ultimately serve to hurt our state economy.  There are no easy solutions to this situation.  Good luck today.

Subject:	med mal question

Governor,
 
I have a strategy question.  Part of med mal reform obviously needs to include improvements in quality.  One area where I think, based on firsthand observation, the state has a definite interest, is in the area of peer review. 
 
I have ideas on this, which I can discuss with you next week, but suffice it to say that many doctors and hospitals shy away from aggressive peer review because of the fear of lawsuits (both because of potential plaintiff's suits, AND from the doctor who is potentially being reviewed/punished).  Believe it or not, I really think there should be strong penalties against hospitals and medical staffs when appropriate peer review is not done, and smaller facilities where there are limited specialists available for review should be sending the review outside, where real action could be taken.
 
I definitely have ideas on this, but have not said anything yet because I want to make sure I'm lock step with you.  
 
Peer review is THE BEST way to achieve improvement, but the state is currently impotent when it comes to enforcing the statute.  If the docs and hospitals won't properly self regulate, it won't work.  THose who oppose caps will argue there should be equivilent improvements in quality, and herein is where you might be able to deliver the answer to that argument.  
 
I want to put this issue on the table, but am reluctant to until I gauge your thoughts.
 
Have a safe trip to DC.  I'm anxious to hear the outcome!

FGA Members and Supporters, 

Please read the below request from Lisa Ockelmann - LoBello. Today and tomorrow, we will experience the coldest blast in nearly ten years and it comes on the heals of high winds and record low existing water temperatures. The chilling effect of this weather is certain to have a negative effect on Florida snook throughout their range. 

Please take time to visit the areas you know hold snook in cold weather and report your findings. In your reports to Lisa and Ron Taylor, please identify yourself as a FGA member. If a poaching violation is seen, please call FWC / DLE at your regional office, identify yourself as a FGA member and request a case / report number. This will allow us the chance to somewhat quantify the frequency and severity of poaching violations and of the cold water kill. 

Thank You, Hope For the Best,

Hi all- 

I haven't spoken with most of you for some time. This email serves 2 purposes. One is to let you know that I now work for the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. You may email me any time at this address or at bluemarine2370@hotmail.com. I would love to hear from all of you. I was very sad to have to leave FMRI, but I wanted to try and pursue my doctoral degree, and this is the best place to do it. I am working for the professor that I would like to be my advisor, as a research associate (a field and lab tech), and things are going well, although Miami is not really for me. I have to stick it out though! I will not know if I got into the program for a few months. 

Now for the second reason I am sending this email. As you all know, we are in for a hard freeze tonight, even down south Florida where we don't usually get freeze warnings. You all know what that holds for our snook. Even though I am not working for the state anymore, I am still committed to this fish and it is what I will be basing my graduate research on. I am so committed that I am helping out my former boss by asking all of the guides and anglers that I knew and were in my region before I left. 

Southwest Florida holds a special place in my heart, as do the snook. I am asking each of you to please communicate with me if you see dead and/or stunned snook. I need to know the location of these snook, as well as an estimate of how many you have seen. There will be someone from each field station of FWC/FMRI collecting the dead snook for age and gender structure studies…it will help us know which fish were most susceptible and where. PLEASE do not collect any snook yourself. 

Law enforcement will be out checking for poachers and you don't want to have to try and talk yourself out of something. FMRI will collect the dead snook, but your reports of the dead or stunned fish are crucial. Please also keep your eyes out for despicable people who are poaching these fish while they are disadvantaged, and DO report them to law enforcement as quickly as possible. Make sure you get FL numbers from the boat or plate # from a vehicle. You are the eyes and ears of this fishery, and we need your help. 

You may contact me at this email address or the one listed above, or call me at 305-361-4782 or 727-403-2084. If I don't answer, please leave a message. You may also contact Ron Taylor directly at 727-896-8626 ext 1510, and leave a message as well, or email him at                 Ron.Taylor@fwc.state.fl.us 
  
Please do me a favor and spread the word to anyone I may have missed, and anyone that you know would like to assist. The snook are in for a tough couple of days, and any help on surveying the number of dead are greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much, and please get in touch with me as soon as you are able. Take care and hope to hear from you all soon!

I too agree that is an issue of concern that the original number of parent
and consumer representation on the Redesign team has significantly reduced.
At the same time, we now have more provider participation as the meetings
probably due in part with the issue of the budget crisis, are open for
public participation.

Since there are several parents and consumers that have not attended
meetings nor participated in the Redesign process in months, I proposed
that those seats be given to others that can attend and are able to be
active participants.  In doing that, I suggest that you give consideration
to representation from different parts of the state.  If you agree with our
recommendation, I can suggest a few individuals that you may want to invite
to replace those that are obviously not able to attend.

Thank you for your continuous support.

Again, I hope that you can schedule the next meeting for Monday 1/27/03.

  Hi Shelly and Susan,
  Although our last redesign meeting covered much ground, there was still
  much that was left undone. I believe this was due to a few main factors
  and
  I believe that our meetings have turned into provider forums. We have
  drifted from the original format. This can be looked at as not
  necessarily negative, however, the "playing field" has become unbalanced.

  I was extremely concerned that there were no consumer representatives
  there.
  I believe there are two factors contributing to this.
  The first is the short notice of meeting. The second is the distance they
  must travel.
  Additionally, there are seats left unfilled by family members who do not
  or cannot attend.
  In our last meeting, it was asked how many providers, parents, consumers
  and advocates were in attendance. Interestingly, providers were raising
  their hands as both advocates (I wish) and providers and parents.
  I would like to also point out, that although it was requested by Susan
  that everyone wait until Mercer was finished to make comment, this was
  ignored by the providers in the audience and the meeting was dominated
  not by stakeholders, but by audience providers. Mercer facilitated the
  dominance.
  The end result was that family members had questions and concerns about
  the information that was given to us by Mercer, but was not given the
  time or the opportunity to review and discuss the issues. Notably, the
  providers from the audience were able to leave early and make earlier
  flights home at their convenience, and we, as family members who have
  given a year of time will have to meet again to finish.
  I realize the difficulty of the situation for you, especially given the
  topic of rates. I only ask that we, consumers and families be given equal
  consideration.

  It is impossible for consumers and families to have equal representation
  when providers can fly up and participate, have the time to review
  information through their affiliation with FARF with expenses covered by
  that "very complex administrative overhead" that our tax dollars provide,
  however, most parents and consumers do not have the same resources to
  attend. I also realize the efforts you have made to give consumers and
  families the opportunity to participate. Sadly, some consumers and family
  members cannot take advantage of the opportunity.
  The point I am making is for the following request or consideration.
  There are and have been substantial seats dedicated to consumers and
  parents who remain vacant.
  If a consumer or parent does not confirm that they will be in attendance,
  can that funding then go to another parent or consumer who can? This
  would at least assist with balancing the makeup of the meeting without
  additional expense.

  I was so disheartened to hear the providers rhetoric, most significantly
  when one of the largest providers referred to the movement of consumers
  residences in the context of, and I quote, "dumping them." This is how
  consumer movement is described, by a person who has applied for state
  leadership position with DS. This, from a board member of FAR who already
  has representation at the stakeholders table.
  It was sickening. And although, he was not a stakeholder, he spent
  significant time debating and commenting. This from a major provider,
  with a district that has some of the highest rates in the state, making
  public comment such as this, without having his comments addressed by the
  state.
  Unfortunately, the language used could, I believe, be a reflection of the
  quality, sensitivity and service delivery consumers experience.
  How sad for our people.
  It was painful for the few family representatives who were there to hear.

  Obviously, this provider had become so comfortable with the makeup of his
  surroundings that he forgot to edit himself.

  Please consider giving additional opportunity to consumers, family
  members and advocates to participate and make their presence known. We
  cannot allow this type of thinking and service to continue. I am sorry
  that I personally did not react more strongly, but to be honest, I was in
  shock of the statement and plan on addressing it personally as a family
  member outside of the redesign.

  The extra time you are giving us to work on the issues that were left
  behind at the last meeting is greatly appreciated by the family members
  and reflects your dedication to the true intent of the redesign. To
  provide quality service at fair and equitable rates directed by the
  consumer's need. I am convinced, that in the end, the consumer will be
  the first consideration, instead of a truckload of funding to be "dumped"
  at the most beneficial provider site.
  Thank you so much for all your hard work.
  Jennifer

I hate to bother you but could you pass me along to someone who handles the
leases for the Dept of Education.  We are leasing a building for a REIT in
Ft Lauderdale and the Dept wants to lease space. The deal is a 4,800 SF
lease that the REIT wants to make minor clarifications to.  We are building
out the space turnkey it is unclear what happens if......  You know the
drill.

The guy we are dealing with is Alan Stucks and he insists that the is no
modification to leases under 5,000 SF- period.  If I could just talk to
someone who can help me understand what if anything could be done it would
help a bunch.    Mr. Stucks as frustrated everyone greatly with his non
flexibility..

Glad to see your cruise went well.


Thanks.

Subject:	Lost Tree Islands

 
The Lost Tree Islands are under a purchase and sale agreement to sell them to a consortium of 4 governmental entities and a consist of a "friendly condemnation" and a "bargain sale."
 
I appreciate your help over the years on this issue and hope this has resolved a long standing problem.  The closing is set for about 2 weeks from now.
 
 
 
 
I also thought you woould get a kick out of this --
 
 



This is a VERY simple way to understand the tax laws 


Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand. 


Suppose that every day, ten men go out for dinner. 

The bill for all ten comes to $100. 

If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this: 

The first four men -- the poorest -- would pay nothing; 

The fifth would pay $1: 

the sixth would pay $3; 

the seventh $7; 

the eighth $12; 

The ninth $18. 

The tenth man -- the richest -- would pay $59. 


That's what they decided to do.The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement -- until one day, the owner decided to give them a break. 


"Since you are all such good customers," he said, "I'm going to reducethe cost of your daily meal by $20." 


So now dinner for the ten only cost $80. 


The group still wanted to paytheir bill the way we pay our taxes. 


So the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. 

But what about the other six -- the paying customers? 

How could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his "fair share?" 


The six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would end up being *paid* to eat their meal. 


So the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out theamounts each should pay. 


And so the fifth man paid nothing, 

the sixth pitched in $2, 

the seventh paid $5, 

the eighth paid $9, 

the ninth paid $12, 

leaving the tenth man with a bill of $52 instead of his earlier $59. 


Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free. 


But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings. 


"I only got a dollar out of the $20," declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth. "But he got $7!" 


"Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man. "I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got seven times more than me!" 



"That's true!" shouted the seventh man. "Why should he get $7 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!" 



"Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison. "We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!" 



The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.The next night he didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. 



But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important.They were $52 short!! 



And that, journalists and college professors, is how the tax system works. 




Lets keep that 10th man coming to Florida for dinner.

I was sorry to here that Jeb Bush cannot attend this wonderful meeting At the Hilton at Walt Disney World Resort.  I don't guess you really understood my special request.  This is a once in a year meeting that moves all over the United States and Canada.  Since this was an election year it was hard to ask before the election and now that is the reason you cannot make it.  Next year it will be in some other state and that Governor will be there.  I had hoped that your schedule permitted just such special request but I guess I was wrong.  If by chance you could get your schedule to work, it is a two days event with Friday night being the BIG one, but we would take a visit from you ANYTIME. Have a great day.

Letter to the editor (01/23/03)

                
                 Eradicate Fraudulent Activities Regarding Manatees

On Jan 6th 2003, I read with extreme interest an article in the Ft Myers News-Press Business Section, entitled "2002 an Innovative Year for Frauds & Swindles". I commend the author for this fine piece of journalism, but would like to identify one other area he missed which needs to be scutinized very closely for fraudulent activity.

Specifically, my concern is with organizations that have a hidden mission/agenda such as, the destruction of personal and property rights. To accomplish their agenda and goals they set up fraudulent organizations (smoke screen type operations) and make them appealing and eye-catching to the public. In many cases, they will choose a very sensitive topic, such as animals, birds, or mammals, which obviously are near and dear to everyones heart, especially our seniors and children. These scam artists are great at manipulating data and information to satisfy their agenda and in most cases  their data is deceptive. One organization even set up an adoption agency so that for a annual fee you can adopt one of  their "whatever"(it's big and lives in the water), but I'm not sure what happens upon the death of this gentle giant, but I'm sure they have another one you can adopt if that happens. I don't think that these gentle giants are really theirs to put up for adoption in the first place. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this sounds like fraud to me.

Most of these organizations file for 501(C)(3) status which allows them to be a tax exempt non-profit organization, but if the truth was known, my guess is that they are far from being non-profit. It's truly mind-boggling how these organizations have the undivided attention of our government services (USFWS & FWS). But after reading about the ENRON's and TYCO's,  It shouldn't surprised me and I should just accept it as unlawful common business practices which we witness more and more each day in this great country of ours.

Let's make 2003 the year that we eradicate these phony outfits, by writing our officials in Washington,D.C. and Tallahaassee and inform them that you are sick and tired of all the lies and deception that these organizations disseminate.
Its time to de-rail this runaway freight train. I'm suggesting a "full court press" (100% Audit) of these organizations financial status and compliance with the tax exempt 501C(3) requirements with a published written report on the findings. Let's start with the SMC (Save the Manatee Club). Our state government owes the citizens and taxpayers an explanation and proof that these organizations are in  compliance with the 501(c)(3) requirements. Tax-exempt non-profit organizations categorized under IRC 501(c)(3) in federal law are generally permitted to "lobby" to some extent, but are absolutely prohibited from engaging in "political activity". My opinion is that they have many of our politicians in their back pockets and I call that fraudulent.

Dear Governor,
I just wanted to alert you that I encouraged Lia Sweeney of Manhoney Cohen Family Office Services in Boca Raton to apply for an appointment to the Children's Service Council of Palm Beach. I do believe she would be a wonderful addition to the council. She is past Comptroller of the Sun Sentinel and is located in the South part of the county, adding a more rounded representation to the Council.
She had applied last quarter and requested her application remain active.
I hope you will consider her for this quarter since we have three appointments open.
I was so sorry to miss the inaugural celebrations especially since I had to be up in New York on business in colder weather than you had that day.
I'm back up in New York now for one of my clients and the temperatures are below zero. I can't wait to return to Florida even with our cold front.
Thanks for your consideration.

Subject:	Regional Transportation Authority

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I most certainly appreciate Armando Codina recommending that I e-mail to you information on our quest to establish a Regional Transportation Authority.  I know you are very busy, so I will do it on a “bullet basis”.
 
1.  Our transportation infrastructure in South Florida is being outpaced by growth.  
     
i.e.)       a. From 1982-1999 population increased 42% and commuter miles 62%.
             b. For every increase in 5 people, 6 vehicles are registered.
             c. Time spent in congestion increases currently at 14 % a year.
 
2. For the first time in history the county commissions from each of Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach have unanimously agreed on something and that is to face the transportation problem “as one” and erase the invisible political barriers on an equal basis.
 
3. The three County Commissioners have agreed that the quickest way to work together is to transform the existing Tri-County Commuter Rail Authority into the Regional Transportation Authority…same board make-up…same staff…no new bureaucracy.
 
4. The Tri-Rail Mission would incorporate rail, cross county bus, and regional transportation land use planning such as the FEC Railroad Corridor.
 
5. Funding the expanded role of this renamed agency would be accomplished by a $2.00 surcharge added to each vehicle registration.  This fee would be levied only upon approval of the Three County Commissioners as would be authorized by the State Legislature.  The County Commissioners have unanimously agreed to do this if the Legislature allows it.
 
6.This $2.00 surcharge would raise approximately $4.8 Million dollars, and creates a “dedicated source of revenue” required by the Federal Government to be eligible for Federal Transit Funding.  Leveraging this money could represent hundreds of millions of dollars for the South Florida Region.  Without the “dedicated source” we can not even apply for the money.  These matching funds are created by reauthorization of T-21 federal funds which occur only every 6 years.  We must act now or be out of the running for 6 more years.
 
The Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) is critical to South Florida.  It enhances our quality of life –it is good for business, it is a great return on dollars invested!  If I can answer any questions or provide more information, please let me know. 
 
Sincerely Yours,
 
Allen C. Harper

I just learned from House Approps staff that Pombo (Chairman, Resources) and Don Young (Chairman, Transportation and Infrastructure) sent a letter to Speaker Hastert asking him to prevent the 8.5 SMA from being included in the Conference report.  Thus, a victory in the Senate on 6D in the Omnibus Appropriations bill could still be thwarted in Conference, even though we have the support of Chairman Bill Young and the other Appropriators.

House approps staff is convinced that unless calls from the WH and Gov. Bush are made to Hastert, Don Young, and Pombo, the language won't survive conference.

Here is a brief statement that develops the idea about how the State can 
save substantial funds while complying with the class size amendment, and, 
at the same time, increase the likelihood that the additional funds will 
actually produce significant gains in achievement for the children who are 
most at-risk for failure in school.  I have done this fairly quickly in the 
time available to me, but could develop it more formally, in consultation 
with other folks at the center, and in more detail after this week. This 
week we are coordinating the review of all Reading First applications in 
the state.

I also want to state at the outset that whether this plan is workable will 
depend on the legal language of the amendment, which I am not familiar 
with.  If it allows districts to calculate class size by dividing the 
number of students in the district by the number of teachers who actually 
provide instruction, then it would be feasible.  If the amendment requires 
actual classes in every school at every grade level be of a certain size, 
then it will be less feasible.

The core of the idea:

We should reduce the student:teacher ratio on our schools by increasing the 
number of teachers in each school available to provide instruction to 
children, not by an across-the-board reduction in the number of children 
each classroom teacher is responsible for.  The extra teachers available 
within each district would be assigned to provide timely, intensive 
interventions to any child who was lagging behind in the development of 
critical academic skills.  These would not necessarily be "pull out" 
interventions, but could be provided either  in small groups as part of the 
regular block for reading instruction, or in after-school programs. For 
example, if an elementary school had 4 "intervention specialists" on staff, 
these specialists could work in classrooms during their normally scheduled 
90-120 minute block of reading instruction to provide small group 
instruction for the most difficult children, while the classroom teacher 
was working with the students who were closer to grade level.  I would 
suggest we start with reading: 1) because of your goals in this area; 2) 
because this is the area we know the most about in terms of identification 
of students who need the extra instruction; 3) because we know how to 
provide the more intensive instruction; and, 4) because of the critical 
nature of reading skill for all other academic subjects.  Some schools will 
obviously require more of these "intervention specialists" than others, so 
they should be assigned to schools according to their needs within a 
district.  The student: teacher ratio should thus be calculated at the 
district level rather than the school level to preserve maximum local 
flexibility in implementation.  The most obvious savings from this plan is 
that it would require no funds to build additional classrooms.


Information and arguments in support of this approach:

1.  Approximately half of Florida's school children are already meeting 
Florida's high standards for reading achievement by the end of fourth 
grade, but less than half meet these standards in middle and high 
school.  It is the students who are not meeting current standards that are 
most in need of improved instructional conditions in school.  These 
students are largely poor and minority children, but substantial numbers 
also come from middle-class homes in suburban schools.  Every school needs 
access to "intervention specialists", but the need will vary depending on 
the characteristics of the children served by the school.
2.  We know from research that the effects of class size reduction vary 
substantially from teacher to teacher: the effects depend largely on 
whether the teacher is able to take advantage of the lower student: teacher 
ratio to change the way instruction is delivered in the classroom.  Without 
substantial additional training in more effective instruction, as well as 
more effective ways of organizing the classroom, reducing class size across 
the board is unlikely to have a substantial effect on reading outcomes for 
our most at-risk children.
3. We know from research that we can improve reading outcomes for at risk 
children if we train and supervise classroom teachers to provide 
evidence-based instruction in reading, but we also know that the 
instructional needs of children in reading are so enormously varied that a 
single classroom teacher cannot meet all their needs (there is not enough 
time in the day) if her classroom contains more than one or two children 
with serious needs.
4.  The most effective way to prevent reading difficulties in young 
children, and to remediate them in older children, is to provide small 
group instruction for a substantial amount of time by a skilled teacher or 
paraprofessional.  In our own studies, we have shown that it is possible to 
prevent serious reading difficulties in all but about 5% of children if 
they are given intensive small group interventions during first grade. In 
many of our schools that have very high poor and minority populations, the 
proportion of children in need of more intensive interventions will likely 
be as high as 60% of the children.  In order to prevent reading problems in 
this group of children, my estimate is that they will require 30-45 minutes 
a day of small group instruction every day for at least two years during 
the period from kindergarten to third grade.  Right now, the means to 
provide this much intensive instruction are quite limited in most of our 
schools.  We are encouraging schools to use their Title 1 money and other 
sources to provide this type of instruction, but the funds are not 
available in all schools, and they are not sufficient in the neediest schools.
5. It is also possible to dramatically effect the reading skills of older 
poor readers if they are provided small groups instruction for about 100 
hours.  There is very good evidence that current approaches to the 
remediation of reading difficulties in older children are ineffective (they 
do not "close the gap") because they are not focused properly or delivered 
with sufficient intensity.  Children with reading problems are most 
frequently placed in classrooms with 15-25 other children (even in special 
education, the teacher is often dealing with groups of 15 children at a 
time).  By contrast to the ineffectiveness of almost all current public 
school programs in remediating reading difficulties in older children, our 
research shows enormous improvements for most children in late elementary 
and middle schools if they are provided with from 60 to 100 hours 
(depending on where they start) of  skillful instruction  in groups of 3-4 
children.
6.  This use (provide funds for "intervention specialists") would have 
enormous synergies with our current Reading First efforts.  As you know, 
Reading First dollars cannot be spent to pay salaries for individuals who 
directly teach children, they can only be used for professional 
development, assessments, and instructional materials.  If we had funds to 
pay for more instructional specialists in K-3, we could use Reading First 
monies to provide training for them.  Reading First money can also be used 
to provide training for special education teachers in grades K-12, and 
these special education teachers (assuming we could locate sufficient 
numbers) can be used creatively by schools to provide instruction not only 
for children formally identified as learning disabled, but also to other 
students with similar instructional needs.

How could such an approach be implemented:

1.  The most important point is that it could not be successfully 
implemented all at once, at all grade levels.  We would need to work out a 
phase-in plan over the period of time consistent with the class size 
amendment, but we could start this fall in all Reading First elementary 
schools, and in a sample of middle and high schools throughout the 
state.  The really nice thing about this plan is that you could expect to 
see immediate (after the 100 hours of instruction) improvements in the 
reading skills of any older children participating in this more intensive 
instruction, and I would predict that substantial numbers of them could be 
moved from level 1 and 2 performance on the FCAT to level three or 
above.  This would be particularly true if we were able to focus on 
children now reading between the 10th and 30th percentile.
2.  The Florida Center for Reading Research could identify a limited set (5 
or 6) of intervention methods and approaches that have at least beginning 
levels of evidence for effectiveness in preventing and remediating reading 
difficulties.  I am currently involved with the Haan foundation in 
California in trying to develop funding for a very large national study of 
intervention methods for older children, and in the process, have held 
meetings with the major program providers for intervention methods in the 
country.  There are at least 6 or so of these program providers (these are 
not the large publishers you are familiar with) that have the capability to 
provide training for substantial numbers of teachers in methods that are 
research based, and have a proven track record. Again, its important to 
emphasize that the training capability of these folks is not unlimited, so 
we would need to focus on a relatively small number of schools until we had 
developed a state-based cadre of trainers and supervisors.  The FLARE 
center at UCF might also be involved in helping to develop a long-term plan 
for the ongoing training of "intervention specialists" in research based 
preventive and remedial programs.  The coaches we have for Reading First 
schools, could also be a big help in the wise allocation of these new 
intervention resources within schools.
3.  We at FCRR could also develop an "implementation manual" for districts 
that would provide step by step guidance in how to implement a successful 
prevention or remediation component in their districts. Of course, 
districts could "take it or leave it", but at least they would have a 
clearly worked out, research-based plan plan to use the new resources 
coming their way.

Again, if you think this might be feasible, we could certainly work over 
the next several weeks to turn it into a formal proposal.  In developing a 
proposal, we would want to coordinate with the folks at DOE (Mary Laura and 
the folks in special education), other specialists in the state, and 
perhaps consult several of the most effective principals we know.

Dear Governor,

As a retired educator of the "Old School", I found this brilliant
analysis of the teaching /learning process by Jann  Flury ringing with a
resounding truth . 
Please peruse this attachment  and consider Flury's logic and research
when you and your education board plan programs and funding for
Florida's teachers. 
I particularly  believe that a National Teacher Certification for all
teachers,  is  a waste of time and money ,since this certificate is a
holdover from the Clinton days  whose sole purpose was to certify
teachers after they  had been completely indoctrinated into the
methodology and beliefs of Goals 2000.

I would appreciate  a response. .

Dear Governor Bush,

Please excuse the length of this note, but, it is of utmost importance, and I know that you are very concerned and read your mail personally.

I totally understand your concern for the policy of every child should learn how to read and should "not be left behind."  However, in the case of certain children who have Specific Learning Disabilities and those children that are classified as Emotionally Handicapped or Other Health Impaired, retention may not be reasonable for all of them. 

There are many children in second grade already who have been retained once and due to the September 1st birthday; they are currently a few weeks shy of 9 ½ years old already.  These children are BIG and retaining them due to a test score is WRONG FOR THEM!  They are doing the best they can and are receiving services as indicated by their IEP's (Individual Educational Plans).  

Unfortunately, many of these children have low IQ's and will never read to the standards they are "supposed to meet."  Thus, if these children cannot perform up to the forthcoming standards, they will be retained twice from K-5.  

The writing assessment in 4th grade will NOT be in their favor either!  Then you come to 5th grade and they could be retained again.  These children in second and third grade are LARGE!  Some of the fifth graders are ready to shave a moustache and the girls have the bodies of women!

It is my belief and that of Educators in the Special Education field that dispensations should be made for theses children if they have had retentions. 

In addition, individualized tests should be given to them rather than putting them through the frustration and emotional torture of the FCAT where they just randomly bubble anything because they cannot read or comprehend what is on the paper/test!  

To an end and to make them productive citizens rather than drop-outs at the age of sixteen (16), these children should be afforded the opportunity to be an APPRENTICE in a field that is of interest to them or guided into a field that their instructors feel would interest them.  In this way, they can at least earn a minimal living. 

As it stands right now, to get into a Vocational High School, students must have an 8th Grade Reading Level which is something that most of them, unfortunately, will never achieve.  The Special Diploma that Florida gives to these students who cannot obtain a Standard Diploma are not even eligible to served in the Armed Forces of the USA and become a Private in the Army! They are INELIGIBLE TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY!  This is a shame.  So many of these students are handy, crafty and able to fix items that an excellent reader has no idea what to do with the item that is broken.  

There MUST be ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE for these children.  
These children are already receiving daily and small group, as well as one to one (1:1) INTENSIVE REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION. 

THIS NEW BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER FOR THESE STUDENTS! 
PLEASE TRY TO FORMULATE AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN FOR THESE CHILDREN WHO REALLY TRY AND HAVE SO MUCH DIFFICULTY DUE TO THE VARIOUS DISABILITIES THAT THEY HAVE.

Hi Jeb!
 
Since I contacted you with all the problems my employee Maria Moya was having with DCF, I thought it might be nice to let you know how she is progressing.  
 
Thanks to a recommendation from our good friends at Greenberg Traurig, Maria has found a wonderful attorney who has had  many cases with DCF  and has taken on Maria as a client. The good news is that Maria and her family now have a little ray of sunshine.    Unfortunately, Maria's parents have had to mortgage their home to pay for the attorney, but they did it willingly, knowing that this attorney may be their only chance to
seek justice in this case.  Originally, I did refer Maria to Legal Aid, but it was a waste of time and energy.
 
Maria's attorney is now setting up a visitation schedule and has
taken over all dealings with DCF.    This alone is a tremendous burden off Maria's shoulders, and we are all grateful for that.
 
Things look so much better now, and I just wanted to thank you for having your staff check into this situation.  Things aren't always as they appear, and there were some serious problems with this entire case.  There are no guarantees from Maria's attorney, but at least she has a well-qualified attorney representing her.
 
Thanks again--would love to have you come down to Aventura to speak to our Chairman's Roundtable for lunch at Turnberry Isle whenever your schedule would allow.

Dear Govenor Bush,
 
It has come to my attention that the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund (BTIITF0 on January 28, 2003, will be considering a land exchange with Mr. David Chapman of Lakeport, Florida. Please accept this note as my strong recommendation for approval of this item. 
 
Mr. Chapman has been in business as the owner of North Lake Estates RV Park Resort for a number of years. Recently he has added a marina and convenience store. Everything he does is in very good taste. Dave and his wife take an active role in Community affairs.
 
If he is approved for this land exchange any business he puts there will benefit the community. Not only will it provide badly needed jobs for the area, but will increase the tax base for the county. This is also needed, as Glades County is very small population wise but large in area. 
 
Thank you for giving this your attention.

Subject: An Idea that you must read about!



Jeb, - This is kinda long but I think well worth it!

 

Just recently I was sitting with my staff in a brainstorming session on ways in which we could fundraise for the school (that’s another conversation).  One of the ideas that came up was a “walk”.  I was not sure how a “walk” could help us until the Holy spirit spoke to me and said.  Why not do a Walk for Literacy or a Walk for Reading?  Here are some possibilities:

 

We begin identifying a booklist at every grade level that children could read over the summer.  Each book based on its level would be worth so much pledges (i.e. a Caldecott could be worth $5 pledge, pleasure reading could be worth $2) and the quantity of books read by that student would qualify that student to be placed in a gold, silver or bronze category of reader.

 

At the end of the summer the kids would come to downtown Miami where we would walk to the public library to a wonderful festival of fun where the children would turn in their pledges and would receive the gold, silver or bronze star pen.  All of the pledges and sponsorship money received would be placed in a fund that low performing schools would be eligible to apply for additional assistance and schools could be awarded money for the number of students participating such $ 10,000 first. 5,000 second 2500. third.

 

Sponsorship for this could come from the publishing companies, book stores etc.  

 

Over the summer there would be activities that would involve the community such as: 

*	Children could participate in read-in at the public libraries, bookstores, community centers and churches   

*	Children could participate in buddy/peer reading in the summer programs 

*	High School children could read with elementary students, college students could read with high school students in sponsored activities over the summer. 

*	Corporations would assign executives to a child from a low performing school to read with them over the summer their list of books. 

 

 

Where I think that the greatest benefit for you is that you can make this a part of your reading first initiative!  Mary Laura Oppenshaw can run this right out of her office.  She is a super organizer.  Come and walk with us not only in Miami but around the state in communities everywhere to kick off reading for the new year.  At your leadership conference last year the lady from Texas (can’t remember her name) said that Reading is the new Civil Right!  Let’s walk for that new Civil Right! You, your Brother, your Mother.  Two generations of believers in Literacy.  This effort alone could boost reading scores for next year.  I also have a format that would work to ensure that students understand what they have read.

Please help make the central access happen here in Orlando. That's all I have really fought for all along is basic street level medical care for addicts and alcoholics. They should at least have a ticket off the streets if they so choose.

Subject: Nihipali juvenile children


Hi Jeb, 
 
Sorry to bother you, but we have a situation here in the Ft. Myers (Lee County) court system, involving custody of the above mentioned children. (Kavika & Kulani Nihipali) These are my great-grandchildren, a 3 yr. old male, and 2 yr.old female, that have been in the DCF system now for a little over a year, with an ongoing custody battle by their Dad in Hawaii. From the information I have, it seems that a hearing was held here within the last few days, and it was determined that these 2 little ones should be returned to their Dad in Hawaii. Jeb, this is a huge mis-carriage of justice that needs to be stopped!!!  The Dad has already FAILED 2 drug tests - why in the name of heaven would anyone even consider giving him custody of these 2 minor children??  Their Mom (my granddaughter) is a drug addict as well as the Dad, and she is exactly where she belongs - just been sentenced to 3 yrs. in prison here in Florida. She lost her "parental rights" several months ago, so she is no problem, as far as the custody battle goes. 
 
These children have been in the home of my daughter, Dena Macomber (this is the one that works at Lee CO. Sheriff's Dept.), for well over a year, in a "foster home" situation, and there is a very nice, upstanding couple that have passed all the requirements set out by DCF to adopt these two little ones, and to think that these little ones will be denied a nice stable home and family, is just absolutely unthinkable. If there is any way possible for your new director of DCF to take a look at this case, and hopefully stop the transfer of the children to a very undesireable home life, all of the family here will be eternally grateful.
 
Thanking you in advance for anything you can do, 
 
Sincerely, Carol Glancy 
 
PS. I did hear back from Brian, and even though the news was NOT good on our part, I do sincerely thank you for your help.

Hi again, Jeb, 
 
I forgot to mention a couple other important issues against David Nihipali in relation to custody of minor children. One being that the man doesn't even have gainful employment. When the children were in Hawaii, they were on the Welfare System. Also, these babies don't even know who this guy is. They were brought to the states in Feb. 2000, at that time the little boy was just 16 mos. old, the little girl was 6 mos. old. They are now established in the home that I told you about, and call the people "Mommy & Daddy". The biggest issue that I left out by mistake is the fact that he introduced my granddaughter (his step-child) to drugs at the early age of 11 yrs. of age!!  He had her smoking "pot", and then when she was about 12, he took her to the home of a friend of his and she was given cocaine. Now, this child at the age of 14, is so addicted to cocaine, that she has prostituted herself ( along with her sorry Mom) to obtain money to support her habit. This kid has been in the DCF system also since Aug. 2000, and has a record as a runaway, 2 counts of auto theft, money theft (over $2,000.00), and just recently, within the past couple weeks was arrested for possession of drugs at school. Now, would that be the kind of future we want for these two innocent babies?? I think not!!!
 
Thanks again, Carol

POWERED BY NEWSPAPERCLIPS.COM	 
. . . but reading gets boost
(Thursday, 01/23/2003 © Orlando Sentinel) 

    	Our position: Gov. Bush deserves credit for putting money behind his
reading push. 

A bright spot shines in Gov. Jeb Bush's austere budget package: Mr. Bush
wants to spend even more money to help Florida's children become successful
readers. 

His decision to stay focused on reading for a second year shows leadership
and tenacity. Improving reading scores in Florida's schools surely is no
snap. More than half the state's students perform below their grade level on
the state reading test. 

Mr. Bush proposes spending $30 million in state money next year on Just
Read, Florida! -- a $19 million increase that would be money well spent. The
reading initiative is a multipronged approach to have all Florida students
reading by the end of third grade and to help every student become a
successful, independent reader. 

The governor proposes concrete help for students who still struggle with
reading in higher grades. His proposal would put more trained reading
teachers into middle schools, where they are desperately needed. 

Giving Floridians a one-month sales-tax break when they buy books, as Mr.
Bush also proposes, is largely a symbolic gesture meant to encourage
reading. Symbols are key to any campaign, though, and no campaign is more
important to Florida's future than one focused on reading. This state has no
hope of improving its quality of life if it ignores this cornerstone of
learning. ADVERTISEMENTS

Jeb:

I know you are already engaged in this, but my folks in Washington say it
is now really crunch time on the "Alternative 6D" issue. They say that
because of what Rep. Don Young has done(see below), White House
intervention with Hastert, Young and Pombo is necessary or the progress we
are making in the Senate could be wiped out in the House.  If there is any
way you can get the right call made from the White House, it would likely
make the difference between winning or losing this issue.

****************

Subject: Discouraging news on 8.5 SMA



I just learned from House Interior Approps staff that Pombo (Chairman,
Resources) and Don Young (Chairman, Transportation and Infrastructure) sent
a letter to Speaker Hastert asking him to prevent the 8.5 SMA from being
included in the Conference report.  Thus, a victory in the Senate on 6D in
the Omnibus Appropriations bill could still be thwarted in Conference, even
though we have the support of Chairman Bill Young and the other
Appropriators.

House approps staff is convinced that unless calls from the WH and Gov. Bush
are made to Hastert, Don Young, and Pombo, the language won't survive
conference.  I'm told that the Governor is already engaged, but we need to
make sure that the WH is as well.  

I suggest making calls to Anne Klee at Interior and Jim Connaughton at CEQ
and ask them to encourage Secretary Norton and Andy Card to weigh in with
Hastert, Young and Pombo.  I'm told that calls will need to be made from the
highest levels of the WH to turn those Members around --  staff to staff
calls won't cut it.  Let's also encourage Shaw, Goss, Voinovich and other
R's to weigh in.

House and Senate staff expect to start conferencing the appropriations bill
this weekend and to have it wrapped up by Feb, 7th, so that is our drop-dead
date for getting the opposition to relent.

I am interested in this position, because I have always believed in the

encouraged as many people as possible to register to vote and vote in all
elections, regardless of their political preferences.

The current staff at the Hillsborough County Elections office has the

On behalf of the average income elder Floridians, who don't qualify for
Med Waiver Benefits, I want to  thank you for placing some monies in
your budget for Community care for the Elderly.

Med Waiver is a marvelous program, but it leaves too many needy elders,
especially those in urban areas, trapped in the social service
eligibility maze. Approximately 2000 of these seniors presently are on
waiting lists in Broward County for CCE services because their assets
exceed Med Waiver Guidelines.

The wealthy can provide for their own needs. We extend our primary
compassion to the poor. However, costs of prescription drugs, amplified
by the cost of living, are destroying the average income population of

My next door neighbor takes care of hisd 100% disbaled Vet father. The man is 58, took a bullet in the back in nam, paralyzed from chest down and in wheel chair. He has a nuirse visit daily to un-impack his bowels and has a catheter leaidng to a pee bag. He apparently has a new social worker at the Tampa Vets Hosp. who is asking the son, how come the old man dosn't drive with aid of handicapped vehicle, they apparently are saying his nursing care is going to be cut off and the son and daughter in law will have to learn to do it them selves. The Son is head chef at a Disney Resturant and works crazy and long hours. The daughter takes care of a 6 and 2 year old (Thiers). She is at wits end as to what the VA is now telling her. I mentioned getting hold of a rep from VFW or Legion that you once mentioned to help. They also told het to the effect there is a 5 year wait to get him in a vets home. The old man also has some mental; problems due to the many meds he takes and needs psychiatric care also from Vets Hosp. Any sites, contacts in Tampa that I can give to the Son (neighbor) that would assist them in getting him proper care. The old man just spend about 3 months in the hospital for a broken knee ater falling out of his wheel chair and they discharged him to home with massive bed sores on his backside. Thanks for anything you can help with.

Dear President and Governor Bush:
Our health care in our country is a huge disgrace. My grandson is 7yrs
old 
and has a severe care of asthma, he has been taken by ambulance to the 
hospital in Daytona twice in 3 days , the hospitals do nothing for this 
child except ask if his mom has upset him to make him have this attack.
First of all my daughter is a wonderful Mother( a single parent) and her

world revolves around Austin ( her son ) what does it take to get a
child 
admitted into a hospital and get the proper care before that something 
happens real bad????

I remember when my children were growing up the first concern was always
the 
childs health never a question the Doctors could do there job and care
for 
them in the matter that each one should be cared for . My grandson is a
"A" 
student in advanced classes, his mother has worked very hard with him
ever 
since he was born. Mr. Governor you sent him a signed photo of yourself
and 
a nice note saying how happy you were that he is doing so very well in 
school , this little boy has not been in school since before christmas
due 
to him being sick there must be something you gentleman can do to help
my 
daughter get something done.
If you need any information you can call me at 727-547-0043 my name is 
Dottie Seubert. sirs I love my grandson very much and am a very very 
concerned grandparent.

Austin's medical file is like a book it is that thick, his Dr here is 
wonderful and if Austin were here on my coast he would have already been

taken care of . Please sir's from a grand parents point of view we need
your 
help to get this child taken care of properly


Thank you for your help
God bless

Subject:	DiMare purchases Fresh America

Fresh America now in the hands of DiMare 

By Ryan Kane

Only two months have passed since Fresh America Corp. confirmed its decision to go private – a move that the company believed at the time, would be the first crucial step in its efforts to dig itself out of a few years of accumulating debt. Yet, the situation took a surprise turn this week, as the Arlington, Texas produce firm revealed it has just been sold.

The buyer, DiMare Fresh Inc. of Homestead, FL, did not reveal a purchase price for its acquisition of Fresh America, but in a press release, said the deal became final on Jan. 22. According to Paul J. DiMare, president of DiMare Homestead Inc., DiMare Fresh was just recently formed to provide “a vertically integrated tomato company with a national presence.”

Mr. DiMare noted the acquisition of Fresh America as an essential part of DiMare Fresh’s goal of growing the business on a national scale. “This new concept will position DiMare as one of the leading national produce companies that can service the needs of anyone who uses produce,” he said.

For Fresh America, the sale became the company’s last resort when faced with the fact that it would be unable to continue due to a breakdown in its discussions with lenders. “We were unable to obtain financing, and that basically led to the sale,” said Fresh America Chief Financial Officer Cheryl Taylor. “The people behind our existing lender backed away and we had talks with a new lender, but those talks broke down.”

Taylor told RBCS that discussions with DiMare began roughly two weeks ago, but that Fresh America had been looking to sell the business prior to that.

In November of 2002, Fresh America announced that it had gone private by filing a “Form 15” with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Plummeting share prices had resulted in the company’s delisting from Nasdaq in 2001, however, Fresh America said its November filing for removal of its stocks on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board was a conscious decision.

Shortly after the filing, Fresh America CEO Mark Prowell told RBCS that becoming a private company eliminated a number of accounting costs, attorney costs and other professional fees. “We have cut several hundred thousand dollars from our annual expenses,” he had said.

Leading up to the Nasdaq delisting, Fresh America had been hit with consistent losses and accumulating debt due to a number of financial set backs over the past few years. From its failed merger with Houston-based FreshPoint Inc., to its closing of several foodservice locations, to the costly shut down of Sam Perricone Citrus, Los Angeles, CA, Fresh America continued to struggle.

However, with the move to go private and Taylor’s then confirmation of a notable amount of debt reduction under Fresh America’s senior credit facility, Taylor and Prowell agreed the firm had made some headway. Though, on the morning of Jan. 23, Taylor’s tone had changed.

“The company has been in serious financial trouble for some time, and it is very much in the hole,” Taylor said. “What’s important now is that the sale to DiMare will be the best opportunity for Fresh America to maximize distribution to creditors.”

RBCS has confirmed that DiMare Fresh purchased equipment, inventories and boxes from Fresh America, and that at least a portion of the facilities involved were leased by Fresh America. RBCS has also been told that DiMare assumed no liabilities in the deal.

“The attorneys are working right now to determine what is owed to creditors, including amounts due to PACA Trust creditors,” said Taylor.

Taylor declined to comment on estimated amounts due to creditors, though RBCS has discovered that at least four separate law firms are in the process of gathering groups of Trust creditors and that discussions were progressing as of Jan. 23.

As for the fates of Fresh America’s employees, especially the executive level management, Taylor noted that the “core group” would stay on with DiMare Fresh. According to the DiMare news release, efforts will be made to build DiMare Fresh with a “dedicated employee base” from Fresh America.

Subject:	December unemployment report
Attachments:	LMS release 01-24-03.pdf; LMS summary 01-24-2003.pdf

Attached is today's release of state and local employment/unemployment data for December 2002. Florida continues to be the nation's stand out in terms of job growth, with a growing job market that created nearly 62,000 more jobs in December 2002 compared to a year ago. This marks the sixth consecutive month of positive over-the-year job growth in Florida.
  
Among the nation's ten most populous states, only Florida and California recorded positive job growth from November 2001 to November 2002 (the latest comparable month available), with Florida leading in both job growth rate and the number of jobs created.
 
Florida's preliminary unemployment rate for December of 5.3% is virtually unchanged from the revised November rate of 5.2% and 0.7% below the rate of December 2001. This is the third consecutive month where our rate is below the year-ago rate.  The U.S. unemployment rate for December is 6.0%.
 
Florida showed a slight increase in the number of initial claims for unemployment compensation in December, with claims increasing by 2.3% over-the-year. 
Our economists indicate that the factors behind that increase are largely seasonal with a portion of it attributed to manufacturing.
   
In December 2002, 11 of Florida's 16 published metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) reported higher nonagricultural employment than a year ago. Miami continued to create the most new jobs over the year (+18,500 jobs, +1.8 percent), followed by West Palm Beach-Boca Raton (+6,600 jobs, +1.3 percent) and Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater (+5,700 jobs, +0.5 percent). 
 
The Orlando MSA continues its rebound with two consecutive months of over-the-year job gains. (+4,500 jobs, +0.5 percent).  The fastest rate of growth over-the-year was in the Tallahassee MSA at 1.9%
 
The county with the lowest unemployment rate is Alachua County at 2.2% followed closely by Monroe County at 2.3%. Hendry County continued to have the state's highest unemployment rate (8.2 %), followed by Taylor County at 8.0%.

	Dear Steve Uhlfelder:
	
	Thanks for your interesting "My View" article dealing with Florida universities measuring results of their work.
	
	Your suggestion for administering an exit exam is an excellent one, however, the motivation by the person taking the test may be enhanced by requiring mandatory standards of performance.  Anything short of this, may bring into question the validity and reliability of the results. 
	
	As an example, when I attended FSU, a junior English exam was administered in four different parts, composition, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.  If a student flunked any part of the exam, they had to take a noncredit course until a satisfactory score was achieved.  In addition, a further measure of compliance was put in place which upon graduation, the student could not receive a diploma until that exam was taken and passed. In my opinion, a student will be motivated to do his very best on any exam given if there are consequences to deal with in case of failure to demonstrate minimum standards of performance.
	
	Comparing this to a manufacturing process, this would be the quality control point of the education industry.  This would tell us quantitatively, how well our workers & CEO's (professors and Administrators) are getting their job done.
	
	I certainly encourage you to assert your ideas on the board. This is the creative thinking that is needed. As a citizen of Leon County, Florida and graduate of FSU, thank you for serving in this most important position of leadership.

Subject: DOT and the giant oak trees


Dear Jeb:
 
    After all the good things you did for Gulf Specimen Marine Lab  in resolving our FWC permits to collect specimens, I hate to bother you with another request. But this time, it isn't for our organization, to save  two giant oak trees in Panacea that DOT is intent on cutting down.  Because they frame the town with their massive trunks covered with resurrection ferns, and add character to the highway, seventeen years ago the citizens agreed to pay extra to have the water and sewer lines routed around them.  While the Wakulla County Commission was willing to listen and consider the aesthetic value of the  trees, DOT is not.   Big red "x"s have been painted on their massive trunks; bulldozers are perched to go, and unless you intervene the trees will be gone in the next day or so. I contacted Steven Monock of the Chipley office, but he insists they are in the way and must go.  If they do, Panacea will be a poorer and shabbier town for it, and most of the citizens I've spoken to don't feel it's necessary.  We regret that we've never given an opportunity to comment on what's happening to our town or involved in the planning process. Citizens called a meeting with their contractor, and express their concern at a Waterfronts Florida meeting in Panacea  several months ago, after  DOT destroyed dozens of virgin slash pines to create giant ditches to improve storm water runoff.  While they may have solved one potential problem, they created another: the ditches are now filled with stagnant water. There are no plans to revegetate them with wetland vegetation where mosquito fish can live, and come summer they will breed mosquitoes and increase our  risk of West Nile Virus. We appreciate the fact that DOT is  widening the road and making it safer for us to drive, but surely there has to be exceptions to their engineer's plans that call for the removal of giant oaks.  Please Jeb,  intervene with DOT and ask them to save the hundred year old trees that give our town character and set it apart from the endless carscapes of the world.  
 
    Best wishes, good luck in your second term, and thanks for your help in the past.  I know a couple of trees is a small matter in the scheme of things, but it's the small matters that count. Best,   Jack Rudloe

Dear Governor Bush,
     I am at the end of my road with my problems concerning employment, and I am questioning my own integrity although I worked a stringent 12-step program since my last conviction/crimes of 1988. I always turn directly to you when the road ends, as you are the only human with the power to overturn any State Government Agency decisions. Being a Christian woman with high moral and ethical values, I never, before our Lord God, could ask you to intervene in anything unless a wrong had occurred. With no gainful job since August 2002, I had no money to hire an attorney to pursue my case, which is so complicated and opens so many cans of worms down to the point that my losing and leaving the nursing home job was not just a cut and dry case of a person resigning. No one, in today's tight job market, would up and quit a job, lose their health benefits with a husband dying of diabetic-related problems and end-stage liver cirrhosis (although clean and sober), myself having clear medical cause that was interfering with my life and job, unless they believed they would received benefits while seeking work elsewhere. My plan was to obtain a counseling job to help persons seeking recovery from addictions, bow out gracefully from the nursing home business. I had so many reasons to leave that job, but I was devoted to my patients, as I was an advocate for them, and I knew that the administration wanted me out of there for fear of me exposing practices that could close them down. I could not continue working and turn my head to unbelievable things, but I have no concrete proof for many of the issues and they knew it. I never wanted to tell you this, but my own family had filed a wrongful death lawsuit in 1999 after my Father, having no legs, fell head first onto a concrete floor in a nursing home, and subsequently died of subdural hematomas, and for which the facility refused to send him out to the hospital for 10 days, even as a begged them daily, and at the facility where I lost my first therapy job, purportedly behind the criminal background check law effective 10/98. I never divulged this as the real reason I lost my job out of fear you would judge my character negatively as I pursued getting my rights restored.  This brings to light the truth as to why I am blackballed from the nursing home business-my Father died as a result of a neglilence, my Family has suffered unnameable pain and suffering, my Mother died as an indirect result of watching my Father in a coma.  My Father was a WWII veteran, awarded Purple Heart, went to work at the Norfolk Naval Air Station as an aircraft mechanic, retired GS-13 1977, assisted in design and upkeep of the F14 Tomcat, was a Mason, Shriner, Mooser, golfer, but most of all, a man of God, who lived to help others and work for his church for free, very humble man, never asking to be paid for his services.  They retired here to Ocala in 1977, had a wonderful life, until my Mother became wheelchair bound.  But I was here since release in 1992 from prison, clean and sober, to take care of all their needs, as he lost his health helping my Mother.  I never got a tax break, but did all I possibly could as they stood behind me, believed in me as a child of God, even when I was doing things against the law to get drugs for a few months out of my life, which lead to going to prison (back in VA).  Never in a million years could I have dreamed I would suffer like I am right now.  I have severe fibroymyalgia and several herniated discs in my back, mostly from work since all the staffing cuts of 1999, having to lift heavy patients without help, else lose my job.  This one boss that was hired a year after me began harassing me in 2000. It is a very detailed story, and I have no proof. However, he wrote me up with issues that were twisted, for he is a master of deception.  The bottom line is they wanted me out of there for I knew too much of what goes on behind the scenes.  I called the AWI to ascertain if I could receive benefits if fired, and was told no. So I resigned my job, for medical reasons, as I had repetitive motion syndrome in my spine which was inoperable.  The boss told me I was on a 30 probation period and if any disagreenent or anything happened, I would be fired.  He had a way of getting patients to say things about me, such as leaving them unattended.  I had to work every Sunday without help, and of course patients had to sit and wait their turn to be wheeled back to their room, one by one. It was a set-up Governor, to ultimately run me out of there.  The good news is that I had been going to school as I told you about before, and got a MA in Counseling.  To change jobs would mean making only half the salary in the beginning of what I made as a PT assistant.  But I had to do it to save my life, which brings me back to the original problem.  It appears the Agency will not allow me to fully present my case because I did not do so prior to the phone hearing back in Oct.  They expected me to have witnesses at my home, which was impossible to ask patients to come here to speak up for me.  I provided the Agency with names and numbers, but they said they don't investigate in that manner.  How was I to present my side if not allowed to come in person and confront my employer with his allegations?  I trusted the system, that since I quit the job for good medical cause and was seeking work in another area, that I would be able to collect benefits while doing so.  Governor, without the back pay for weeks claimed awarded, I will, in just a few more weeks, become among Florida's homeless community.  I understand the Agency saying I could not add evidence to my case, but the Agency lead me with a line of questioning during the first interview that made me believe if I said anything to do with medical problems, I would have to file a workers compensation claim.  That is the last thing I wanted to do.  So I am asking you to override their decision, based on the good medical cause for leaving my job, and if you need to, you can contact my physician, Dr. Stephen Bookbinder  352-3-237-7171, and he has permission to state to your office that he told me to get out of the nursing home business before I end up hurt so bad I become totally disabled.

Dear Governor Bush,

I currently work at PACE Center for Girls in Orange County as the Social

working with another population.  The adolescent girls here are incredible.  
They are full of potential, love and hope.  I urge you to reconsider 
eliminating PACE Center for Girls from this year's budget.  We have a proven 
track record. We need to invest in Florida's future, starting with our 
children.

With tough budget choices it is not easy to decide who stays or who goes, 
however with the need growing to address the fasting growing segment in the 
juvenile justice system we must not ignore the needs of the girls in the 
state of florida. I have seen girls who have turned their lives around by 
coming to PACE.  Please invest in our girls and their futures.

Sincerely,

<PRE>Dear Gov Bush...We read recently where you are considering doing away with a 
requirement to have auto insurance. I hope you look at all the aspects before 
a final approval. We have insurance in the event of a serious accident. The 
reason stated was that 30% of the Florida automobile owners did not have 
insurance. That is not sound rational. Anyway, part of our insurance is 
medical and that is what our EMS/EMT personnel use to get re-embursed for 
taking us to the hospital, etc. The local counties would have to increase 
taxes to pay for this service. Next, to get re-embursed for an accident that 
was not our fault we would have to take it to the civil court and play right 
into the lawyers hands..Just a comment on this issue..bob of Vero

Governor:

Again congratulations on your victory in the election. I enjoyed the inauguration and wish you great success in the next four years. Thank you for mentioning the environment in your inaugural address and for your commitment to conservation since becoming Governor. 

As you may know, I have assumed the position of Southeast Division Director of The Nature Conservancy on a full time basis, and we have hired Vicki Tschinkel to be Florida Chapter Director. Vicki, I, and Roy Rogers (the Florida Chapter Board Chair) are requesting the opportunity to meet with you for 30 minutes to discuss the future of Florida Forever and related conservation funding.

We understand the budget challenges the state is facing and the ambitious priorities you have set for your next four years. We believe the conservation of land and water reinforce your goals of supporting Florida’s economy and its families. As you know, Florida’s natural character is the cornerstone of its attractiveness to tourists and to new full-time and season residents. Conserved watersheds and aquifer recharge areas supply the clean water needed to support growth. Buffering military bases from encroachment has become essential to maintaining a large military presence in Florida. Parks and outdoor spaces are a refuge for families from the difficulties of everyday life. With low interest rates and critical conservation land for sale, we would like to discuss how Florida Forever, Everglades funding and working with the military on base encroachment can continue to create a legacy of parks and clean water for Florida’s future.

We greatly appreciate our similar talks on these issues in the past and your historic support for conservation during your first term. We hope a another such meeting can help establish the foundation for completing a conservation legacy for which Floridians will be grateful in all the years to come. Thank you again for all that you have done.  Bob

Subj:   FMMC - MOAA Legislative Update for Friday, January 24, 2003

Issue 1: Relative Personnel Costs at 20-Year Low: Administration arguments
that military people cost too much are hogwash.

Issue 2: Help MOAA Get a Handle on TRICARE Access Problems: If there's a
serious shortage of TRICARE Standard providers in your area, we need to hear
from you via MOAA's online survey.

Issue 3: Also, Tell Your Legislators About TRICARE Problems: The February
issue of Military Officer magazine has three tear-out letters you can send
to Congress and the Secretary of Defense.

Issue 1: Relative Personnel Costs at 20-Year Low

Over the past few months, we've heard various administration officials -
some in the Pentagon and some in the Office of Management and Budget -
complain that personnel costs take up too much of the defense budget.

They've used that lame rationale as justification to oppose fair
compensation for disabled retirees, resist military manpower increases
needed to ease the strain on servicemembers and families overstressed by
manpower cuts and mission increases, and even propose to cap future military
pay raises for the troops we're now sending to war. As we reported in last
week's update, at least the President stepped in and put the kibosh on that
last one.

But all these claims that the country can't afford the cost of fair and
reasonable manpower and compensation programs led us to check a few
statistics. And the data show that those claims are unadulterated hogwash.

In FY2002, personnel costs made up 25% of the DoD budget. The only time that
number has been lower in the last 25 years was the "hollow force/erosion of
benefits" era of 1979-81 (21-23%). But that doesn't tell the real story
either. There are more things than personnel costs that affect that
statistic...such as how much is spent on procurement. What happens when
Defense takes a "procurement holiday" as has happened over the last decade?
The personnel share of the budget goes up, that's what. If procurement had
continued at the pace that virtually everyone in government now recognizes
was actually needed, the personnel share of the defense budget would have
been much lower.

Personnel costs comprised 30.8% of the Defense-minus-procurement budget in
FY2002 - vs. 37% in 1991, 47.6% in 1986, and 34% in 1976. Today's figure, by
that measure, isn't far from 1981's 28.6% low.

Rather than bemoaning the current figures, Defense budget hawks should
consider that personnel accounts would have to be raised another $6 billion
to restore the 1990's ratios. And that's before you even consider the size
of the Defense budget itself, which has plummeted as a percentage of the
Gross National Product - the best measure of the nation's economic
capability.

In 1976, the Defense Budget stood at 5.4 percent of the GNP. That figure
rose in the 1980's, but began to decline towards the end of the Cold War.
The Defense budget now stands at 3.2 percent of the GNP -- barely half the
1986 figure, and still far below the 5% of 1979's military doldrums. See
more data at www.moaa.org/Legislative/BudgetRatios.asp .  We say again: with
a force that's 30% smaller than it was 15 years ago, it's not personnel
costs that are the problem.

It's the failure to recognize that the cost of needed people program
upgrades, long-delayed modernization, and ever-increasing operations with a
much-reduced force can't be balanced on the backs of active, Guard, Reserve,
and retired members and their families and survivors without long-term
retention and readiness consequences.

Issue 2: Help MOAA Get a Handle on TRICARE Access Problems

Most legislative update subscribers know that a top MOAA goal is to attract
more providers to participate in TRICARE. We're talking to legislators and
Defense officials about legislative and policy options to accomplish that
goal.

But the discussions always start with, "We need your help in identifying the
specific areas of the country with the most significant access problems and
gathering data about the extent of those problems."

If we're going to help get the problem solved, we need your help in getting
our arms around it in a very specific way.

To that end, we've set up a simple survey form on MOAA's Web site
(www.moaa.org/Legislative/TRICARESurvey2003/) to let MOAA members and others
provide information on problems you have experienced in finding doctors who
will accept new TRICARE Standard patients.

The response options are limited so we can consolidate answers in a database
format, but we've also provided a space to describe the problems in your
area in your own words.

The more input that we get from you, the easier it is to say what those
areas are, and the more ammunition we have to fight for your benefits.

Please remember that the focus of the survey is on how hard it is to find a
TRICARE provider in your area, not on problems with specific providers or
claims issues. And it's important to address only recent conditions
(experiences occurring within the last 12 months). We can't base current
initiatives on data from several years ago.

Issue 3: Also, Tell Your Legislators About TRICARE Problems

The February issue of MOAA's Military Officer magazine will hit the street
next week, and has a centerfold with three tear-out letters for members to
send to the Secretary of Defense and the Chairmen of the House and Senate
Armed Services Committees.

The letters urge actions that will make TRICARE more attractive to providers
and require DoD's health care contractors to help TRICARE Standard
beneficiaries find participating providers.

We hope you're willing to foot the cost of three stamps to get this message
to senior officials in positions to help address these important problems.

Dear Gov. Bush:

 

Keeping in tune with increasing public service efficiencies while reducing government growth and spending, I wanted to introduce/note or recommend an efficiency that I believe directly compliments your three (3) priorities of reading/literacy, diversifying the economy and strengthening families.  In-light of the impending challenges of the upcoming budget year of 03-04, I believe that further cost saving may be realized through consolidation of prevention service dollars across various state agencies.  According to OPPAGA’s November 2002 Juvenile Justice Prevention review report which cited 1.2 billion dollars of uncoordinated prevention service funding spread across various state agencies.  These prevention dollars if consolidated and effectively coordinated would address the aforementioned priorities listed above. In the event that a faith base office is created, the 1.2 billion dollars of existing administrative personnel, office space, expense and service dollars if consolidated into the faith base office or department of state/community partnerships would be of tremendous savings; not to mention the increased coordination of services with uniformed measurable outcomes attached to each service.  I wanted to try to keep this short while providing as much information to delivery an impact; unfortunately it went a little long.  I have much more detailed information if this is of interest and would be honored and interested to participate or facilitate if this becomes of any serious consideration.           

 

Respectfully,

 

Rod Love

Subject: unfairness of FCAT and 3rd grade ESE students



Mr. Bush,

I am a VERY concerned parent of a 3rd grade ESE student and how she is being 
affected by the new law "No child left behind".  I don't know if the people 
who made this new law ever took into consideration the affect it would have 
on ESE students and their self-esteem.  I can't believe any of you have.  Do 
you have  any idea how a student with a learning disability struggles on a 
day to day basis.  My daughter is a child that gives 110% effort to her 
class work and homework and she even makes "B" honor roll since 2nd grade 
and is still making "B" honor roll today, but if she doesn't pass the FCAT 
est with a 2.0 she will be retained.  Do you know what that will do to her 
self-esteem?  I do!!!!  It will beat it down,we will lose all the ground we 
have made.  All we have ever told her is to give it your all at school do 
your best and she has, but now that is not enough.  How can that be?  If you 
have a child who already has a couple of cards stacked against them , not 
you are throwing the entire deck on her.  I know that you formed a Blue 
Ribbon Task Force to look at this issue, but I understand it hasn't really 
helped, ESE students. ESE students have accommodations written into their 
IEP to make sure that they are meeting their goals also set up in their IEP, 
but during the FCAT test not all of the accommodations will be aloud.  For 
instance my daughter is to have ALL her work read to her because she has a 
very big struggle with reading because she is Dyslexic and SLD. She meets 
her goals every year that are in her IEP, so how can one test make or break 
her?  Does that seems fair to you?  The other part of this is that an ESE 
student  that has an IEP is covered under the federal law, IDEA, now state 
law wants to supercede that. I am not a lawyer but I don't think that is how 
it works.  I have filed a formal complaint against the State of Florida with 
the Office of Civil Right for discrimination against ESE students.  I have 
formed a parent organization to fight for all the right of ESE in my area of 
St.Lucie county, our name is P.O.S.S.E., which stand for Parents of Students 
in Special Education and we plan on fighting this FCAT issue completely.  We 
attend a meeting on the 21st of this month in West Palm Beach and from that 
meeting we are gathering to file a class action suit against Florida and 
also parents were encouraged to file a complaint with the Office of Civil 
Rights and I believe many of them did.  As parents if we don't stand up and 
fight for our children's right then who will.  Our thought is that during 
the last election (when you were re-elected) there was an amendment to make 
sure that pigs are treated kindly, I would think that we can pass a law on 
how ESE students deserve to be treated, and how to they should be helped to 
succeed in life.  Please take a serious look at this.  I know that all of 
the parents I have been talking to would love to have some further 
accommodations made for ESE students for the FCAT or even a way of an 
alternative assessment.

Thank you for your time from a very concerned parent,


Barbara Ball

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
My organization, along with several other pro-family groups, is pushing to bring the Choose Life vanity license plates to Texas.
 
Since Florida was first, and because we Bush opinions count for a lot here in Texas, it would be really helpful if you had a positive quote to give us regarding the adoption and rapid sale of these plates in Texas.  As I recall, you and your mother are particularly supportive of adoption, which is benefited by the sale of these plates.
 
We would really like to see Texas follow Florida's lead on this, and if you can help in any small way, that would be grand.
 
Thank you for your consideration in this regard.  Thank you also for the sacrifices you and your family make for public service.

Dear Jeb,
It's me, Kim Scarola (KScar15000).  Our home was burglarized yesterday while we were at school/work.  They took some of Bill's police uniforms, badges, my home computer and a bunch of other stuff (over $10,000).
Please pray for us, especially my children John and Kelly.  They broke in through Kelly's window.
I never imagined in a million years this would happen to us, but luckily we were not hurt.
Please pray for us, especially the kids.
On a good note, I have started a program at Pembroke Pines Charter School called "Caught Reading".  I am the Safety Patrol Coordinator as well.  The Patrols monitor the morning hallways in search of students who are reading (seated quietly) while waiting for school to begin.  Names of students "caught reading" are entered into a weekly prize drawing aired live on the morning announcements.  It is a hit!  I know that Reading is special to you--thought you'd like to hear something positive!
I am hoping to see you this year at Community Reading Day.  I'll email you as soon as I hear any dates.  God Bless you!
Anxiously awaiting FCAT day (LOL),

I wanted you to be aware of the nomination I submitted for an award to be presented by ANCOR, which is a national organization that represents service providers in the disability arena.  When I reviewed criteria for nomination, I felt no one other than our own Governor, exemplified the ideals that ANCOR professes better than you.

I would like to nominate Governor Jeb Bush of the state of Florida for the ANCOR award to be presented by the National Governors Association Conference.

Governor Bush has just been overwhelmingly reelected to his second 4-year term as Governor of Florida.One of the reasons for his overwhelming reelection is his commitment to the disabled citizens of Florida.  During his first term, the Governor inherited a Developmental Disability Program that had been inadequately funded for the past 8+ years.  He was facing numerous lawsuits that were filed to address the long waiting lists, some of the people on these lists had been waiting 10+ years for services.  To say that Governor Bush faced a crisis would be an understatement.  Much to the Governor's credit, he faced the crisis head on and began the arduous task of getting much needed funding out of the Florida legislature to address some of these inequities.  In 1998, when the Governor took office, the total budget for Developmental Disabilities was $502 million, for Fiscal year 2003/2004, his proposed budget is 1.096 billion, this is an increase of 118%.  His commitment to the Developmentally Disabled has never wavered.  Every major state of the state speech he has discussed his commitment.  He has also been instrumental in developing what he called "Family Care Councils".  These councils were designed as a conduit of information between he state government and the families of Florida's disabled citizens. These councils also had a direct link on the states web page as a form of information sharing for all concerned parties.  He has also instituted a "System Re-design", which included such unique programs as "Consumer Directed Care" and "Flexible Services Menus", both concepts are new to Florida's disabled citizens.

To commend Governor Bush for his commitment to the Developmentally Disabled seems so inadequate, we should all speak of his accomplishments and encourage him to continue to show this level of leadership to his fellow Governor's, much as he did on a state level.  His Leadership on disability issues, and his commitment to the disabled citizens of Florida has never wavered, and for that we are certainly grateful to have such a committed leader in the state of Florida.

If you would like additional information on Governor Bush, please do not hesitate to contact me either via email or at 305-325-0112.

I. Every cognizant State Court, when presented with            7
 uncontroverted, credible genetic testing evidence of non-
paternity, is required to render void for want of subject 
matter jurisdiction, the previous, underlying, judgment of 
paternity.

II. Upon a finding by the cognizant State Court that a        11
previous judgment of paternity is void, that Court must 
Order the refund to the newly-proven non-father, of all child 
support, whether court ordered or voluntarily paid while 
under mistaken belief of paternity, collection expenses, and 
court expenses.

Petitioner respectfully prays that a writ of certiorari issue to 
review the Decision entered herein by the Supreme Court of 
the State of Georgia on January 9, 2002.


OPINIONS BELOW

The 1/9/02 Memorandum Decision of the Supreme 
Court of the State of Georgia appears as Appendix A. The 
decision of the Georgia Court of Appeals dated 7/10/01 
appears as Appendix B. The Decision of the Superior Court 
of DeKalb County, Georgia in Civil Action No. 98-12744-9 
dated 5/14/01 appears as Appendix C.

JURISDICTION

The judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court was 
entered on January 9, 2002. This petition for certiorari is 
being filed within 90 days of that date. Jurisdiction is 
invoked under 28 U.S.C. §1254(1).

STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED

None specifically invoked.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

A large, well defined, class of civil cases exists 
across the United States in which some Courts routinely 
persist in failing their fundamental duty to do justice. In 
these cases, the court rules that a status of paternity exists, 
and when later confronted with credible, conclusive 
scientific evidence of non-paternity, by way of the relatively 
new, reliable "DNA Test", refuses by artifice and avoidance, 
to reopen the matter, release the erroneously implicated 
"non-father" from financial liability, and further refuses to 
reimburse the "non-father" for sometimes huge past child 
support assessments having no lawful basis.

A civil state court acquires subject matter jurisdiction 
over the financial duties of a "putative father" only if that 
man is in fact the biological or adoptive father of the subject 
child. Releasing such a man from the financial duties of 
fatherhood is not discretionary, when, not being an adoptive 
parent, that man is demonstrated by the clear result of DNA 
testing not to be the biological father. Such demonstration 
finally and without recourse constitutes ab initio lack of the 
court's subject matter jurisdiction over the subject of the 
demonstrated non-father's duty of financial support.

Lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at 
any time, for it goes to the most crucial connection by which 
a court acquires the right and obligation to exert that court's 
power over the affected non-father. The subterfuge of 
refusing to deal with wrongful paternity adjudications by 
claiming "laches", or excessive passage of time, cannot 
lawfully be applied to matters later shown to lack ab initio 
subject matter jurisdiction. 

Nor may the fiction of paternity be maintained in 
light of wrongful conduct by any party, for subject matter 
jurisdiction is a fundamental litigative necessity which is 
neither created nor destroyed by litigative action; rather, it 
either exists as a factual basis, or it does not. 
A court, upon finding that it lacks ab initio subject 
matter jurisdiction, has a very high duty to expeditiously 
declare its lack of such jurisdiction, and to restore the status 
quo ante, that is, to declare that the erroneously declared 
father is not, and never was, the actual father, and further, 
that any child support paid by him under the false impression 
of his paternity, or by court order, be wholly refunded to 
him.

Petitioner Carnell A. Smith, representing himself, 
hereby petitions that a Writ of Certiorari issue to the Georgia 
Supreme Court regarding the denial by that Court on January 
9, 2002 of leave to appeal from the Order of the Honorable 
Edward A. Wheeler, Senior Judge, Stone Mountain Judicial 
Circuit , Superior Court, DeKalb County, dated May 14, 2001.

Petitioner respectfully submits that the Superior 
Court of DeKalb County committed fundamental error at 
law, in denying to Petitioner a new trial, sought on August 
28, 2000 (less than three years from entry of the Superior 
Court's Consent Legitimation Order dated July 28, 1999, and 
its March 2, 2000 Visitation and Child Support Order) based 
upon newly discovered DNA evidence of non-paternity. 

Further, that each of the involved Georgia Appellate Courts 
failed to abide by their respective mandatory duty to examine 
a claimed lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, by refusing to 
grant Petitioner's Applications for Discretionary review.
Petitioner further submits that the Superior Court of 
DeKalb County committed fundamental error at law, in 
denying retrial of an order of legitimization originally based 
upon application and consent of the de-facto non-father 
before he suspected Plaintiff/Respondent's fraudulent 
concealment.

The Application to the Court of Appeals urged, and 
the subsequent State Supreme Court Petition for Certiorari, 
or alternatively, Application for Discretionary Appeal 
necessarily re-urged, that lack of de-facto biological 
paternity deprives the Superior Court ab initio of subject 
matter jurisdiction to assess statutory child support from the 
non-father, or to enter or perpetuate an order of 
legitimization as to the non-father.

Since lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be 
raised at any time, it would, if recognized herein, establish 
precedent broadly applicable in every State, to all defrauded 
biological non-fathers who are wrongfully refused cessation 
of child support orders and reimbursement for formal or 
informal past payments of child support arising from a 
mistaken belief in their paternity status. 

Wrongful perpetuation of Georgia Court Orders 
assessing child support when the parties and the courts 
become aware that Jurisdiction for such orders is lacking 
(because the man so ordered is not the biological father 
intended by the legislature) rises to constitutional 
dimensions, and is a crucial matter of nationwide 
importance, justifying this court's resolution by 
establishment of a nationwide precedent. No United States 
Supreme Court precedent specifically prohibits such a 
miscarriage of justice. 

This Application is the ideal vehicle for reaching a 
precedent upon which all paternity litigants may rely, and is 
therefore a matter of national public interest. Public trust and 
confidence in our court system is shaken so long as the 
fiction which perpetuates the child support order below, is, 
along with similar cases, the continuing subject of public 
outrage and media attention.
Petitioner was led to believe, during pregnancy of his 
former intimate, Respondent Toni W. Odum, that the child 
she carried was his. She concealed from him for about a 
decade, the possibility that he was not the father. Relying 
thereon, Petitioner paid voluntary child support, and later, in 
the caption-referenced Paternity matter, paid court ordered 
support. By counterclaim, Petitioner in good faith secured 
the child's legitimization and court-ordered custodial and 
visitation rights. 

Only thereafter did Petitioner first become aware of 
the possibility of his non-paternity. Two DNA tests have 
each conclusively excluded him as father. The Superior 
Court on May 14, 2001, denied Petitioner's motion for new 
trial, based upon his not having earlier availed himself of 
DNA testing before he had reason to suspect he might not be 
the father.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

The question of subject matter jurisdiction is not 
discretionary, but is rather a matter of law which may be 
raised at any time.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The parties resided together and had a sexual 
relationship, which ended when they separated. Shortly after 
such separation, Respondent/mother informed Petitioner of 
her pregnancy, and claimed that he was the father. She 
deliberately concealed the fact that she contemporaneously 
had had sexual relations with another man. Thus deceived, 
Petitioner acted as father by developing a relationship with 
the child and paying voluntary child support. Eventually, the 
parties disagreed as to the amount of a mother-demanded 
increase in child support, and she on January 28, 1999, filed 
the paternity/support action to which this petition pertains. 
Petitioner counterclaimed and was granted court-ordered 
custodial and visitation rights, as well as an Order of 
Legitimization.


Only thereafter was Petitioner advised by third 
parties of the possibility that he was not the father. He 
secured a DNA test, and his non-paternity was confirmed. 
Mother then demanded a second, independent DNA test, 
which resulted in the same outcome. She and her counsel 
stipulated to temporary cessation of child support, but when 
Petitioner refused to absolve her of reimbursement of the 
approximately $40,000 he had already paid for a child that 
was not his, she and her counsel resisted the entire new-trial 
procedure. The order, to which this Petition pertains, 
perpetuates the de-facto baseless child support order and 
legitimization.

REASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT

INTRODUCTION

The Superior Court of DeKalb County committed 
fundamental error at law, in denying to Applicant, based 
upon purported lack of "due diligence" a new trial of Child 
Support and Legitimization based upon newly discovered 
DNA evidence of non-paternity.

Lack of de-facto biological paternity deprives the 
Superior Court ab initio of subject matter jurisdiction to 
assess statutory child support from the non-father, or to enter 
or perpetuate an order of legitimization as to the non-father. 
The Court of Appeals and the State Supreme Court both 
committed fundamental error at law, in denying the 
Application for Discretionary Appeal, founded on lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction, thereby creating a sub silentio 
ratification and perpetuation of the trial court's exercise of 
non-existent subject matter jurisdiction.

1.
Every cognizant State Court, when presented with 
uncontroverted, credible genetic testing evidence of non-
paternity, is required to render void for want of subject 
matter jurisdiction, the previous, underlying, judgment of 
paternity.

The Petitioner should have been routinely, and 
mandatorily, allowed to proceed with his motion for new 
trial because it attacked a previous final judgment which 
dealt with paternity and child support, and was based on 
evidence which was discovered after the Superior Court's 
Final Order. (FN1,2.)

Footnote 1: See Roddenberry v. Roddenberry, 255 Ga. 715, (1986)

Footnote 2: "On an extraordinary motion for a new trial based on newly
discovered evidence, it is incumbent on the movant to satisfy the court: (1)
that the newly discovered evidence had come to his knowledge since the
trial; (2)that want of due diligence was not the reason that the evidence
was not 
acquired sooner; (3) that the evidence was so material that it would 
probably produce a different verdict; (4) that it is not cumulative only; 
(5) that the affidavit of the witness is attached to the motion or its 
absence accounted for; and (6) that the new evidence does not operate 
solely to impeach the credit of a witness." Human Resources v. 
Browning,  210 Ga.App 546, 547 (1993).

The trial court wrongfully denied the new trial, by 
finding that Petitioner had failed to exercise due diligence. 
More specifically, lack of due diligence was attributed by the 
Trial Court to Petitioner's failure to earlier avail himself of a 
DNA test on litigative occasions when Petitioner earnestly 
and in good faith believed himself to be the biological father, 
in reliance upon Mother's fraudulent withholding from him 
of information to the contrary.

Petitioner had no reason to believe that he was not 
the father of the minor child since the Mother repeatedly 
assured him that he was in fact the biological father. 
Therefore his duty of "due diligence" did not begin until 
after he had first been alerted by third parties that he might 
not be the only male to have been sexually active with the 
Mother during the period when the child could have been 
conceived. Petitioner initiated a DNA test promptly after 
being so alerted. (FN3) 

Footnote 3: "Where a purported father has no reason to suspect the fidelity
of the mother, it may not be unreasonable, and in fact may be admirable, for 
him to acknowledge his paternity without further proof thereof. The law 
should not punish a purported father for failing to insist on a paternity 
test when he has no reason to believe that he is not the father. A contrary 
rule would invite suspicion and distrust, and essentially require all 
purported fathers, upon divorce or separation to accuse their spouses or 
partners of infidelity by demanding proof of paternity." Smith v. 
Department of Human Resources, 226 Ga.App 491, 493 (1997).


The trial court extrapolated that the mere fact of 
separation of the parties gave to Petitioner "... knowledge, at 
the time he was informed of the pregnancy, that the parties 
were no longer in a monogamous relationship and therefore 
he was on notice that he might not be the father". Order, 
Appendix C, p.3 (original numbering), lines 19-22. Nothing 
in the trial record supports such judicial extrapolation. It is a 
non-sequitur. This court should take judicial notice that 
cohabiting couples, married or not, are not necessarily 
behaving monogamously, and further, that couples who 
separate are not necessarily thrust into a libertine lifestyle. 
Such judicial extrapolation should be deemed an abuse of 
discretion.

The Petitioner was repeatedly assured by the Mother 
that he was the biological father of the minor child. The 
Mother voluntarily withheld information that would have 
caused the Petitioner to doubt the fact that he was the father 
of the minor child.

The admitted fact that the Mother required assistance 
of a physician to "determine" (without contemporaneous 
DNA or any blood testing) that "Mr. Smith was the Father", 
including the counting of days relative to missed 
menstruation, is probative of the Mother, Toni Odum 
knowing from the very beginning of her pregnancy that there 
were two potential fathers. Her "physician's assistance" in 
her "determination" would have been unnecessary had 
Petitioner been the only man with whom she had 
contemporaneously engaged in intercourse, casting doubt 
upon her professed certainty as to actual paternity.
Provided with the information that he was not the father 
of the child, Petitioner would never have been ordered by the 
Superior Court to pay child support and he would never had 
agreed to voluntarily pay child support for more than ten 
(10) years. The evidence of non-paternity would have 
prevented the Mother from obtaining child support from the 
Petitioner.

The Mother committed fraud against the Superior 
Court in several respects:

First, by failing to disclose the possibility of another 
father, she created an omission from the record of the final 
hearing. 

Second, the Petitioner innocently relied on this 
omission to his detriment. For more than ten (10) years, 
based upon false pretenses advocated by the Mother, the 
Petitioner provided the Mother with over forty thousand 
dollars ($40,000.00) in child support.  (FN4) 

Footnote 4: See Gary v. E. Frank Miller Construction Co., Inc., 
208 Ga.App. 73 (1993).

Third, the Petitioner reasonably relied on the 
Mother's assertion that he was the biological father of the 
minor child. The Petitioner had no reason to believe that he 
was not the father of the minor child, and the Mother never 
informed him of the possibility that he may not be the father 
of said child.  (FN5)

Footnote 5: See Barret v. Independent Order of Foresters, 
625 F.2d 73 (5th Cir. 1980).

Throughout the proceedings below, Petitioner 
persisted in misinterpreting the claimed "advice by 
Petitioner's Counsel" to "secure a DNA test". Nowhere does 
the Mother show such purported attorney advice to arise 
from any factually-based suspicion of non-paternity. The 
Court may take judicial notice that a proposal to seek DNA 
evidence is nowadays likely to be a routine procedural 
suggestion made by every attorney defending his client 
against child support obligation in any paternity case.

To become aware of the public availability of DNA 
testing, from a billboard or by suggestion by counsel, is not 
the onset of a duty of due diligence. It is the realization, for 
the first time, that facts exist probative of a different man 
being the father, that should be the trigger for a fresh duty of 
due diligence.


II.
Upon a finding by the cognizant State Court that a previous 
judgment of paternity is void, that Court must Order the 
refund to the newly-proven non-father, of all child support, 
whether court ordered or voluntarily paid while under 
mistaken belief of paternity, collection expenses, and court 
expenses.

As a direct result of the fraud, the Plaintiff was forced 
to relinquish a very substantial amount of money to the 
Mother, which has inflicted a grave financial harm to him. (FN 6,7)

Footnote 6: See Haynes v. Fincher, 241 Ga.App. 179 (1999).

Footnote 7:  "It is a well recognized principle that one may not retain
money or 
goods which have come into (her) hands through mistake and which 
(she) is not, in good conscience, entitled to retain." Department of 
Medical Assistance v. Presbyterian Home, Inc. 200 Ga.App. 885, 887. 

The Plaintiff fraudulently obtained over forty 
thousand dollars ($40,000.00) from the Defendant through 
deceit. When misrepresentation of a material fact has 
occurred by one of the parties, then legal fraud has occurred 
and the party can recover damages based on that fraud. (FN 8)

Footnote 8: See Morton v. W.T. Tharpe & Co., 41 Ga.App 788 (1930).

Therefore, the Plaintiff should not be allowed to profit from 
the fraud she perpetrated against the Court and the Defendant 
should be allowed to recover from the Plaintiff the damages 
he incurred due to her fraud. (FN 9)

Footnote 9: See Price v. Mitchell, 154 Ga.App. 523 (1980).
    
Lack of de-facto biological paternity deprives the 
Superior Court ab initio of subject matter jurisdiction to 
assess statutory child support from the non-father, or to enter 
or perpetuate an order of legitimization as to the non-father. 
The trial court found, at Order, Appendix C,  p.3, 
lines 14-18, that:
"... the Consent Order of Legitimization and Child 
Custody established paternity and legitimated the 
child of these parties."

That cannot be so. Legitimization can only be 
accomplished by the biological father. Petitioner is 
absolutely not that person. (FN 10)

Footnote 10: See Clements v. Phillips, 235 Ga.App. 588, 
510 S.E.2d 311 (Ga.App. 12/03/1998)
 
There is no doubt that the DeKalb County Court 
acquired personal jurisdiction over the Mother by her filing 
of the paternity action, and over Petitioner, by service of 
process. But personal jurisdiction does not form a foundation 
for subject matter jurisdiction. Since Petitioner is not a 
biological parent of the subject child, the Paternity Statutes 
do not vest the Superior Court with subject matter 
jurisdiction to order the non-parent Petitioner to pay child 
support, nor does that court have subject matter jurisdiction 
to order a "Legitimation" regarding, or initiated erroneously 
by, a non-parent.

The Superior Court's subject matter jurisdiction to 
assess child support against an "unwed father" does not exist 
when such a defendant is not the de-facto biological father. 
The Georgia legislature granted power to the Superior Court 
in paternity cases to determine contested paternity, but did 
not grant power (subject matter jurisdiction) to make any 
child-related paternity orders impinging upon a non-parent. 

Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be created where it 
does not exist, nor is it created by agreement or waiver. (FN 11)

Footnote 11: "...Must a judgment already rendered be set aside because of an 
alleged structural error to which the losing party did not properly object? 
There is no reason in principle why that should always be so. It will 
sometimes be so - not, however, because the error was structural, but 
because, whether structural or not, it deprived the [federal] court of its 
requisite subject-matter jurisdiction. Such an error may be raised by a 
party, and indeed must be noticed sua sponte by a court, at all points in 
the litigation, see, e. g., American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 
U.S. 6, 17-18 (1951); Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 
379, 382 (1884); Capron v. Van Noorden, 2 Cranch 126, 127 (1804)." 
Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991) JUSTICE SCALIA, with 
whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE 
SOUTER join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
(emphasis supplied)

As the U.S. Supreme Court indicated in Freytag, id., 
the issue of Subject Matter Jurisdiction not only may be 
raised at any time, all courts have an affirmative duty to 
examine the issue when it is raised by a party, or sua sponte. 
Purported lack of "due diligence" by a litigant does not 
affect that affirmative duty. The Court of Appeals or State 
Supreme Court should not be permitted to sub silentio ratify 
the trial court's jurisdictionally defective exercise of power to 
continue application of a mistaken child support order 
against a non-father.

Indeed, the Court of Appeals and State Supreme 
Court lack power to so ratify on a theory that Petitioner 
Carnell Smith "waived" by purported lack of "due diligence" 
his right to seek the setting aside of the manifestly baseless 
child support order. (FN12)

Footnote 12: "Since such a jurisdictional defect deprives not only the
initial court but also the appellate court of its power over the case or
controversy, to 
permit the appellate court to ignore it because of waiver would be to give 
the waiver legitimating, as opposed to merely remedial, effect, i. e., the 
effect of approving, ex ante, unlawful action by the appellate court 
itself." Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991), id. JUSTICE 
SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE KENNEDY, 
and JUSTICE SOUTER join, concurring in part and concurring in the 
judgment.
 
When paternity is declared, legitimization is ordered, 
or child support is imposed, and the Court becomes aware of 
dispositive evidence of biological non-paternity, a decision 
such as that herein, denying retrial on the basis of alleged 
lack of due diligence, violates the court's duty of 
jurisdictional self-examination. Just as the execution of a 
criminal defendant known before the execution to be 
innocent is an affront to our Constitution, the maintenance of 
a manifest fiction in order to perpetuate a financial obligation 
and avoid "delegitimization" of a child violates the 
Fourteenth Amendment rights not only of the non-father, but 
also the substantive rights of the child. (FN13)

Footnote 13: "It goes without saying that a child has an interest in not being 
legitimated by someone who is not his father. See, e.g., In re Ashmore, 
163 Ga. App. 194, 195 (1) (293 SE2d 457) (1982) (any interested party 
may file objection to legitimization petition). The fact that the mother 
was a participant in a fraudulent scheme to have the child wrongfully 
legitimated does not lessen this interest. Legitimation is not a game, and 
the child is not the prize." Clements v. Phillips, id. 235 Ga.App. 588, 510 
S.E.2d 311 (Ga.App. 12/03/1998)

Although there was initially an assumption herein by the 
Superior Court that it had acquired Subject Matter 
Jurisdiction by virtue of the Petitioner's voluntary agreement 
to such a declaration of status, once proof of non-paternity is 
presented, the Superior Court must, however reluctantly, 
admit that it never actually had subject matter jurisdiction. 
Granting a new trial is not discretionary in such 
circumstances, to rectify the mistaken previous judgments 
and orders; it is necessary in the interests of justice. (FN 14)

Footnote 14:  "...I write separately to point out the 
absurdity of the present state of 
the law that requires a putative father to pay child support after he has 
scientifically proven that he is not the biological father. As I stated in 
Smith v. Department of Human Resources, 226 Ga. App. 491, 493 (487 
SE2d 94) (1997), 'the law should not punish a purported father for failing 
to insist on a paternity test when he has no reason to believe that he is not 
the father.' Not only has the putative father been cuckolded, the law adds 
injury to insult by requiring him to pay child support even after he 
establishes that he is not the biological father. Once non-paternity is 
scientifically established, courts cannot ignore such fact by relying on 
policies developed when no such proof was possible. To create a fiction 
in this matter does not make the male the biological father of the child; it 
simply makes him the victim of the law. It also makes an ass of the 
law....While the courts may preach their false policy, they lose the 
respect of any citizen with common sense" Georgia Department of 
Human Resources v. Pinter, 241 Ga.App. 10, 525 S.E.2d 715 (Ga.App. 
11/18/1999) BLACKBURN, Presiding Judge, specially Concurring.


O.C.G.A. 19-7-40 clearly provides that the Superior 
Court and the state courts have jurisdiction of paternity and 
child support. But once there is proof of non-paternity of the 
non-father, neither the Superior Court nor the state appellate 
courts remain vested with Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
regarding him to require, assess, or perpetuate child support.

The United States Supreme Court, earlier in the 
present 2001-2002 term, denied Certiorari in a Texas-based 
case wherein review solely invoking the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution had been 
denied to a divorced man. He had discovered, via post 
divorce health-related blood testing, that he was not the 
biological father of multiple children born during the 
marriage. While the divorced man did not, as herein, raise 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction in his Certiorari Petition, 
he recited a number of valuable cases showing proper post-
decree reversal of paternity findings and monetary 
consequences in States other than Texas. (FN 15)

Footnote 15: Wise v. Fryar, Petition for Writ of Certiorari, U.S. Supreme 
Court No. 01-562, cert.den., which cited, among others, the following cases:
White v. Armstrong, 1999 WL 33085 (Tenn. Ct.App 1/27/99);
De Filippis v. United States, 567 Fed.2d 341, 343-44 (7th Cir. 1977);

Dixon v. Punchy, 979 P.2d 520, 526 (Alaska 1999)
  
The Orders herein sought to be vacated are arguably 
void ab initio. That does not mean that the court does not 
still have a task to perform in rectifying its previous error. 
While the Superior Court manifestly lacks Subject Matter 
Jurisdiction over matters of current or future support 
regarding Petitioner in this case, it retains personal 
jurisdiction over the Mother, for having caused Petitioner to 
be damaged through jurisdictionally defective invocation of 
the Court's power.

CONCLUSION

Petitioner, having been subjected to provably void 
Subject Matter Jurisdiction, has standing to raise a facial 
challenge against that exercise. Invalidation on constitutional 
grounds goes directly to the power of a Court to hear, try, 
and adjudicate a matter wholly based upon an ab initio lack 
of the necessary biological relationship by which a de facto 
father is constitutionally made a party to a paternity action. 
Petitioner lacks the capacity to "forfeit" the question of 
subject matter jurisdiction. He can, and has, properly and 
expeditiously raised the issue for the first time in the trial 
court, and at every appellate level thereafter. He could have 
raised it for the first time in seeking Certiorari.
For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner should not have 
been denied re-opening of the Paternity, Support and 
Legitimation case.
The United States Supreme Court should choose 
whichever of the remedies sought herein it deems 
appropriate, and either grant Certiorari and then upon 
briefing and argument, reverse the Georgia Supreme Court's 
denial of Discretionary Appeal, or more directly use its own 
original discretion to grant a Discretionary Appeal.
Upon recognition of the jurisdictional principles 
argued herein, this Court may short circuit any extended 
appellate proceedings and fashion such direct remedies it 
deems reasonable, including but not limited to directly 
ordering the Superior Court to reopen proceedings so as to 
stop the child support order, and order that 
Petitioner/Applicant be fully compensated for the more than 
$40,000 fraudulently received by Mother , plus costs.


Respectfully submitted this 9th. day of April, 2002.

			O R D E R 

The above-styled case came before the Court for a 
hearing on April 16, 2001 on  Defendant's "extraordinary 
Motion and Brief for New Trial to Set Aside Child Support 
and Grant Defendant Relief Based on the Plaintiff's 
Perpetrating Fraud Upon the Court band Defendant" as 
amended. Both parties were present and represented by 
counsel. The Court has considered and reviewed the file, the 
motion and response, and has heard evidence and argument 
of counsel.

Procedural History
On December 17, 1998, Plaintiff filed a verified 
Complaint to Establish Paternity and Set Child Support 
pro se, although she later retained counsel. On January 28, 
1999, Defendant, represented by counsel, filed a verified 
Answer and Counterclaim for Legitimation. The parties 
presented the Court with a Consent Order of Legitimation 
and Child Custody signed by both parties and their 
respective counsel, which the Court signed and filed on July 
29, 1999. That same day, the Court signed and filed a second 
order for temporary child support and visitation. On 
February 29, 2000, the case came for trial on the issues of 
child support and visitation; after a lengthy bench trial at 
which both parties testified, the Court signed and filed an 
order on March 2, 2000 setting visitation and ordering child 
support of $750.00 per month. On March 31, 2000, 
Defendant, the father, filed "Defendant's Motion to Modify 
or in the Alternative Motion for reconsideration of the Final 
Order" asking the Court to allow him more visitation with 
the child. A hearing on that motion was scheduled but 
canceled at Defendant's request. On August 28, 2000, 
Defendant filed the motion now before the Court and 
informally requested time for the parties to undergo genetic 
testing to determine the paternity of the child.

Findings of Fact
It is undisputed that the history of the relationship is 
as follows: the parties, who were dating but not living 
together, considered themselves to be in a monogamous 
relationship until Defendant told Plaintiff that he wanted to 
date other women; after some time had passed and the 
parties were no longer dating, Plaintiff informed Defendant 
that she was pregnant with his child. It is undisputed that the 
child was born in December 1988.
At the hearing, Plaintiff testified that she always 
considered Defendant to be the father of the child because 
she had physical indications of possible pregnancy 
immediately after the parties had stopped seeing each other, 
before she was intimate with anyone else. Plaintiff testified 
that she did not know until she received the results of the 
paternity test in the year 2000 that Defendant was not and 
could not be the father of this child. Defendant testified that 
Plaintiff told him she was pregnant and he was the father of 
the child some time after the parties stopped dating each 
other, at a time when he considered himself free to date other 
women and he considered Plaintiff to be free to date other 
men. Defendant testified that, when  he retained an attorney 
to represent him at the onset of this paternity action, that 
attorney advised him to take a paternity test and he said no.
The Court finds that the Consent Order of 
Legitimation and Child Custody established paternity and 
legitimated the child of these parties. The Court finds that 
Defendant has abandoned his Motion to Modify regarding 
additional visitation, as he is now asking this Court to relieve 
him of the duties of fatherhood.

The Court finds Defendant had knowledge, at the 
time he was informed of the pregnancy, that the parties were 
no longer in a monogamous relationship and therefore 
Defendant was on notice that he might not be the father. The 
Court finds that Defendant knew he could request a paternity 
test before he counterclaimed to legitimate this child, but did 
not do so. The Court finds that Defendant did not exercise 
due diligence in ascertaining paternity of the child and that 
Defendant's want of due diligence was the reason the newly 
discovered evidence of paternity was not known to him 
sooner.

Legal Standard
The Georgia Supreme Court held that extraordinary 
motions for a new trial on the basis of newly available 
evidence are not favored: The requirements for granting an 
extraordinary motion for a new trial are clear. On an 
extraordinary motion for a new trial based on newly 
discovered evidence, it is incumbent that the movant satisfy 
the court: (1) that the newly discovered evidence has come to 
his knowledge since the trial; (2) that want of due diligence 
was not the reason that the evidence was not acquired 
sooner; (3) that the evidence was so material that it would 
probably produce a different verdict; (4) that it is not 
cumulative onlt; (5) that the affidavit of the witness is 
attached to the motion or its absence accounted for; and (6) 
that the new evidence does not operate solely to impeach the 
credit of a witness. [Cits. and punctuation omitted] Patterson 
v. Whitehead, 224 Ga. App. 636, 638(3) (1997), citing 
Roddenberry v. Roddenberry, 255 Ga. 715, 717 (1986).

Conclusions of Law
Defendant has not proven, by a preponderance of 
evidence, that Plaintiff perpetrated fraud upon him or this 
Court. Defendant is not entitled to a grant of a new trial 
based on newly discovered evidence because he failed to 
exercise due diligence in acquiring such evidence timely. 
Roddenberry, supra. Therefore Defendant's "Extraordinary 
Motion and Brief for New Trial to Set Aside Child Support 
and Grant Defendant Relief Based on the Plaintiff 
Perpetrating Fraud Upon this Court and Defendant":, as 
amended, is DENIED.

SO ORDERED this 14 day of May, 2001.

Governor Bush, please take a strong stand, to avoid future problems by not adding additional layers of bureauacricry in ADM. A Division of Mental Hygiene, with its own, separate funding source, with a Psychiatrist in charge to assure, best outcomes and recovery. This will (like the welfare system reform) allow the mentally ill to exit the treadmill, (status quo) and really "get-on" with the treatments and outcomes leading to recovery, even serious mental illness, not capable of recovery, will be better served with a higher quality of life. This will also lower the incidences of crisis, and high-end cost attributed to the current crisis driven, reaction system now in place. A local Health Department will be more answerable to unique County problems, their community, with legislative directives to follow, outlining that the head of the Division of Mental Hygiene, will make independent decisions, affecting treatment plans, and funding uses.

Governor:  the state did a wonderful thing when it came down and tested the soils of some of the properties around wingate.  the state then removed the dioxin it found on those soils. but just those soils it tested. i went out and tested a property next to the property the state tested and it also tested way above the others for dioxin.  

the city and broward county refuse to do anything about the dioxin in the soil. none of the public schools have been tested even though they are in the area tested by the state which indicated excessive dioxin in the adjoining soils. 

please check into this.  dioxin is killing this neighborhood and this neighborhood can no longer depend on the county/city\'s democratic politicians to be its steward. please read what the pope says in the attached article: not about the suv\'s but the part on environment.

ZENIT News Agency, The World Seen from Rome  
==================================================

Would Jesus Drive an SUV?
Christian Groups Take Aim at Gas Guzzlers

NEW YORK, JAN. 11, 2003 (Zenit.org).- Gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, long the bane of environmental groups, are now under attack from Christian organizations. Driving a SUV could well be un-Christian, according to the Reverend Jim Ball, who directs the Evangelical Environmental Network.

The Washington Post on Nov. 8 reported that Ball's group has launched a series of ads on Christian radio and TV, accusing SUVs of damaging the environment. It's not the only salvo fired by Christian organizations in the ecology debate. The Post noted that over the last three years the Interfaith Climate and Energy Campaign, a project of the National Council of Churches and the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, has set up groups in 21 states to promote conservation and the use of cleaner fuels.

For its part the National Religious Partnership for the Environment wrote an open letter to automobile company executives urging them to build cleaner cars, the Christian Science Monitor reported Nov. 22. The letter noted the call made in Scripture to be stewards of creation. In the light of global warming, "we're not doing well by this covenant," said Rabbi David Saperstein, head of Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.

The initiative sparked off a lively debate, with some criticizing the religious groups for undue involvement in political and social issues. The Washington Times noted Nov. 29 that some critics accused the activists behind the campaign of "promoting pagan earth worship and pushing an agenda that has more to do with politics than prayer."

The article noted that Paul Gormon, founder and executive director of the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, cut his teeth as a speechwriter for Senator Eugene McCarthy's 1968 anti-war campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Others active in founding the partnership include U.S. Senator James Jeffords of Vermont and then-Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado. Wirth is now president of Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation, which supports population-control programs.

Writing in the Los Angeles Times of Jan. 6, Auden Schendler, director of environmental affairs for Aspen Skiing Company, explained why people are concerned about SUVs. According to Schendler, every gallon of gasoline burned is estimated to put 20 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A 5-mile-per-gallon increment in improved fuel economy would keep 10 tons of carbon dioxide from being released over the lifetime of a vehicle. He also noted that SUVs emit 30% more carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and 75% more nitrogen oxides than standard passenger cars.

Many people, he commented, don't drive SUVs "because they're bad human beings," but rather "because there are no comparably priced options with better gas mileage that offer equivalent safety, convenience, performance and comfort."

Aiding terrorism?

A more extreme form of opposition to SUVs is that espoused by the Earth Liberation Front. Members of this radical green group had claimed responsibility for a fire at a Pennsylvania auto dealership, the Associated Press reported Jan. 4. A statement on the ELF Web site said the "attack" targeted SUVs in a fight "to remove the profit motive from the killing of the natural environment."

Violence is also on the minds of those promoting a campaign scheduled to kick off Sunday, Jan. 12, the Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 8. On Sunday the Detroit Project, a coalition headed by columnist Arianna Huffington, is scheduled to begin airing TV ads in several U.S. cities, accusing SUVs of leading to higher U.S. imports of oil.

The oil imported by the United States, alleges the ad, comes from countries that help finance anti-American terrorists. SUV owners, says the argument, are thus guilty of indirectly supporting terror groups, by sending more money to these countries.

The Wall Street Journal observed that the auto industry loves SUVs because the profit on each vehicle sold can reach up to $10,000. One in four vehicles sold last year in the United States was an SUV, said the Journal, citing statistics from Autodata Corporation, an industry research firm.

A Christian view

Just how justified is religious-based concern over environmental problems? John Paul II has clearly (and repeatedly) expressed his worry over ecological matters. His message for World Day for Peace 1990 noted that "there is a growing awareness that world peace is threatened not only by the arms race, regional conflicts and continued injustices among peoples and nations, but also by a lack of due respect for nature, by the plundering of natural resources and by a progressive decline in the quality of life."

Theology, philosophy and science, the Pope observed, "all speak of a harmonious universe, of a 'cosmos' endowed with its own integrity, its own internal, dynamic balance." "The human race," he continued, "is called to explore this order, to examine it with due care and to make use of it while safeguarding its integrity."

Ecological problems, he noted, are often due to greed and selfishness, which "are contrary to the order of creation, an order which is characterized by mutual interdependence." Caring for the ecology should lead society to take "a serious look at its lifestyle," said the Pope. "In many parts of the world society is given to instant gratification and consumerism while remaining indifferent to the damage which these cause."

This concern of the Pope goes a lot deeper than ecologists' concerns about banning gas guzzlers. The ecological problem "is not simply economic and technological; it is moral and spiritual," declared the statement on ecological matters signed by the Pope and the patriarch of Constantinople last June 10.

"A genuine conversion in Christ will enable us to change the way we think and act," noted the document. We must be humble, recognizing the limits of our power, knowledge and judgment, it continued. "A new approach and a new culture are needed, based on the centrality of the human person within creation and inspired by environmentally ethical behavior stemming from our triple relationship to God, to self and to creation."

In the past, some critics of Christianity have argued that its focus on the human person leads to a disregard for the environment. But, in his address to the World Summit on Sustainable Development last Sept. 2, Archbishop Renato Martino, head the Holy See delegation to the meeting, stated: "Placing human well-being at the center of concern for the environment is actually the surest way of safeguarding creation."

Promoting human dignity will lead to defending the right to development and also the right to a healthy environment, explained Archbishop Martino. The defense of these rights will, in turn, stimulate "the responsibility of the individual toward self, toward others, toward creation, and ultimately toward God."

This responsibility will also imply, he observed, the practice of global solidarity. This solidarity among peoples involves promoting the common good and being attentive to the needs of others.

Church teaching, then, does not stipulate what sort of car we should drive. It asks a lot more than that. It asks us to defend a genuine human ecology, based on humility and respect for God and creation. In turn, each individual has to answer in his own conscience what this means for his lifestyle.

I just returned from the US Conference of Mayors in DC and wanted to pass along my thoughts.
 
The 3 day conference seemed to be dominated by mayors and speakers critical of the President's policies, complaining that he and the federal government are not helping cities enough, and I fear that this may be the primary message received by the White House.  I believe, and the President acknowledged today, that the federal budget needs to be passed so local Homeland Security programs can receive some relief, but there is a bigger message which I feel needs to be stated.
 
In the month after Sept. 11th, I issued a hiring slowdown, followed later in the year by a significant reduction in non-uniform force, accomplished completely through attrition (no one lost a job); our departments tightened their belts considerably and returned significant budgeted funds back to the general fund, unspent, at the end of the year.  We continued to improve services (new pool; new libraries, new athletic fields; quicker sidewalk and pothole repairs; increased compensation for police and fire; etc); we established a Homeland Security team revising emergency plans, reviewing facility hardening and conducting biological and chemical terrorism exercises for Florida's west coast (with support of the DOJ); we absorbed the worst combination of cost increases and revenue losses that the city's long-time staff can recall; and we ended the year without raising real estate taxes but with an unexpected moderate general fund YTD surplus for Florida's 4th largest city.
 
I am not saying that we are the best run city or that the future will be easy.  In fact I believe that next year's city budgets may be even harder, and I hope you will keep this fact in mind in your State budget deliberations.  My point is that there are many in America's cities who recognize that we have a responsibility to lead beyond simply asking others for help; who support the President's domestic and foreign programs; who believe that there is a federal funding role for Homeland Security issues but also recognize that we have to assume greater responsibility; and who feel it is our duty to prepare our community, through fiscal management and security measures, so that the burden on our federal government will be lessened, especially in a time of war.
 
When the President spoke to the mayors at the White House this morning I was hoping to make this point, but time did not allow for questions or comments.  If you ever have an opportunity to pass along my thoughts I believe it would be helpful for him to know.
 
God bless

Hi Jeb,

The Orlando Sentinel had article last month about you encouraging volunteer mentors to help students. Frontline Outreach was mentioned.

I am pleased to hear that as I had started a SWAT Club there. I also have clubs in the Boys and Girls Clubs in the inner city. We just started a club at the Wayne Densch Center here in Eatonville.  They have secured an entire apartment project that is for homeless families.  The parents are so proud to have their teens involved with such a positive anti-tobacco program, and we are excited about this site.

My program here in Orange has been funding anti-tobacco projects for church youth groups ever since I have been Tobacco Prevention Coordinator.  A portion of my funding goes to local churches to provide anti-tobacco information to their teens. We did an Anti-Tobacco Night at House of Hope--which was well-received.

I have always worked in the inner city--ever since "Project Three" days.  In addition, I have an active Tobacco-Free Partnership with many members in the community who are dedicated to helping our youth.  

One member, Pastor Thompson, has a unique program which we are funding:  Teens who are suspended from school for tobacco violations are hanging around his church all day.  We are providing funding for a three hour per day--three day per week program to teach an "Anti-tobacco Reading Program."   to these teens in the streets. We are working with Evans 9th Grade Principal and the minister.

I am active here with all non-profits--so please have  Liza McFadden contact me if she needs any help in Orlando.  

Hopefully, you are still considering having a "Governor's Office of Non-Profits"--or is this it?  I know of a foundation in Jacksonville that gave a million dollars to North Carolina office to create such a project.

We need one office that would list all non-profits while highlighting their mission.  This would be a great benefit to these smaller agencies as well as all  non-profits. It is difficult and expensive for non-profits to advertise.

We also have a large Grants Professional Network as well as Philanthropy Center here at Rollins College.  There are so many resources that need to be empowered and promoted statewide.

Well--as usual, all the best, thanks  and many  Prayers for you and your family.

Loved the Christmas Card--Thank you.

Governor, I know from your comments that this has been a very difficult
budget for you to put together, and I just wanted to say thanks for doing
everything you could to limit the pain on community colleges.

I told our presidents and trustees to be thankful to you, and note the
decreases in the university budget, and be thankful they are not in
California (or many other states for that matter). I'm chair of the national
organization for state college chancellors this year and all of them are
telling horror stories of cuts this year. 

Gray Davis has proposed a $530 million cut in community colleges alone, and
a doubling of tuition. (see article below from Chronicle of Higher
Education.) 

Still, we'll keep working to see if we can get the enrollment funding up if
the legislature can find the money, but I know that will be tough. We
appreciate your comments about your wish that there were more funds for
enrollment.

Finally, I'm very excited about the role we can play in addressing class
size. Through more dual enrollment and charter schools at community colleges
we can help with enrollment, and with Student Success as well.

California Governor Seeks Deep Budget Cuts and Doubling of Tuition at
Community Colleges
By JAMILAH EVELYN

Just as they were preparing for sizable midyear cuts in state
appropriations, community-college leaders in California were blindsided this
month by a second dose of bad news. Gov. Gray Davis proposed doubling
tuition and slashing the colleges' funds again in 2003-4 to help offset what
is expected to be a $35-billion state-budget deficit.

Take almost the entire undergraduate population of the University of
California -- some 146,000 students -- and that is how many people will be
shut out of the two-year colleges, those officials say, if the governor's
proposal is approved by the Legislature this summer.

The state's community colleges enroll a total of about 2.4 million students.

The plan would reduce appropriations for community colleges by some
$530-million, or 10.5 percent. Although the state's two other systems -- the
University of California and California State University -- sustained cuts
of their own, community-college leaders point out that those institutions
are raising tuition and those dollars will stay on the campuses, helping to
offset the cuts the governor has proposed for them. Community colleges must
give their tuition dollars to the state. The net result has
community-college leaders crying foul.

Even Thomas J. Nussbaum, chancellor of the 108-college system, who is
usually reserved in expressing opposition to the state administration, is
speaking up. "We have a struggling economy and a huge need to create
additional jobs, and the community colleges are the state's largest
work-force providers," he told The San Diego Union-Tribune. "So what are we
doing here?"

Leaders of every state agency say they were prepared for significant cuts,
but community-college officials say they were caught off guard by what they
see as the disproportionate cutting of their budget. The proposal has
sparked a vigorous political debate, with community-college leaders and
others accusing the governor of making the state's neediest residents bear
the brunt of the budget crunch.

"Give me a fair cut and I'll take it," says Kevin M. Ramirez, president of
Sierra College, who is also president of the Chief Executive Officers of the
California Community Colleges. "But don't aim at students who are already
marginalized by higher education. That's a classist mistake."

'Pay More, Get Less'

The spending plan could actually lower appropriations for community colleges
below what state law allows. It would reduce reimbursements for
full-time-equivalent students to $4,026, from $4,684. The governor, who had
cut community-college tuition twice during the economic boom of the late
1990s, has also proposed raising tuition to $24 per credit hour, from $11. 

"He's proposing to ask students to pay twice as much and get a lot less,"
says Scott M. Lay, director of state-budget issues for the Community College
League of California, which represents presidents and boards of trustees.

When community-college tuition was increased in the early 1990s, enrollment
fell roughly 1 percent for every dollar that tuition rose. Estimates of how
many students would either drop out or choose not to enroll because of the
new tuition proposal and reductions in programs have varied from 45,000 to
nearly three times that number.

The governor, a Democrat, acknowledged that his proposal would keep some
students out of the two-year colleges. Accordingly, he cut their state
appropriations for 2003-4 to take the decline into account.

Presidents of two-year colleges are calling the plan the toughest financial
challenge they've ever been through. 

Many had already decided to suspend dual-enrollment programs, which allow
high-school students to take college classes, and to eliminate most, if not
all, of their summer courses after Mr. Davis last year called for a
10-percent cut in the $6.5-billion designated for community colleges in
2002-3.

Now, with the governor's new budget proposal for the next academic year,
community-college leaders are predicting significant reductions in their
academic offerings and possible faculty and staff layoffs.

At Sierra, Mr. Ramirez says, he has already eliminated 350 course sections,
cut most courses that did not enroll more than 20 students, deferred capital
expenditures, and imposed a hiring freeze. After the governor's
announcement, the college's Board of Trustees voted to tap half of the
institution's $7-million in reserves to avoid layoffs.

At Cabrillo College, the president, John D. Hurd, says he has already frozen
hiring, clamped down on equipment upgrades, and cut back on weekend and
evening hours in the library and computer labs. 

If the governor's proposal goes through, he estimates, the college would
lose 4 to 6 percent of its $50-million operating budget, which would mean
letting go of adjunct instructors and reducing by up to 10 percent the
number of classes the college offers.

Protests Expected

Legislators are expected to be busy hashing out the governor's midyear cuts
through the end of the month. Meanwhile, community-college officials are
mobilizing their constituents and calling for organized protests of next
year's budget proposal at the state Capitol.

Mr. Ramirez says he used his college's convocation last week to advise
students and faculty members to lobby their state representatives to oppose
the cuts.

In the summer of 2001, Mr. Davis had proposed cutting $98-million from the
community-college system's budget. He later restored about one-third of that
after an aggressive lobbying campaign by the colleges. That success has
officials optimistic about persuading lawmakers to restore some of their
funds. State Sen. Jack Scott, a Democrat and the chairman of the education
subcommittee of the Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, has promised to try
to help mitigate the cuts.

"But the reality of the state's budget does not bode well for us," says Mr.
Hurd. "We're cautiously optimistic."

The proposal needs bipartisan support to make it through the Legislature.
Many Republicans have already vowed to oppose the plan because it also calls
for tax increases for California's wealthiest residents. 

What's more, some economists say the governor has overestimated the deficit,
which may help the community colleges make a case for minimizing the cuts.

"Still, for every dollar we want to restore," says Mr. Lay, of the
community-college league, "we have to find that money somewhere else." 

The Legislature is supposed to approve the annual budget by the end of June,
but did not do so last year until September because of wrangling over the
governor's proposals. Budget discussions are expected to last until the end
of this summer as well.

just moved from Miami Beach to Ocala which will now be his frist home. I

It seems that there are patterns of policies and practices within school districts that open the potential for significant waste or corruption.  We could examine these patterns to identify the problems & forge corrections to enable the districts to achieve program and faciliities goals with currently available resources.  

We could review practices in the districts to determine how pervasive the problem is and how it could be resolved state-wide. If you found it useful we could also form a task force to pinpoint the issues and recommend changes. I have a few aspects of this done already.  Another possibility would be to assign inspector general personnel and/or FDLE to look into these matters or to provide support to the task force should one be created. 

I'm afraid that the pipeline of capital funds is suffering from many leaks that prevent reasonable productivity from being attained.  Here in the state's largest district, the leaks are being protected better than the state's resources are;  I know you are well aware of the extent of resistence to change and accountability.

I'd also like to explore the possibility of having the school construction effort benefit from the experience and and expertise of  FDOT; I think that a multi-agency, multi-use approach could prove to be very productive and cost effective in the long run.  

I will continue to help however you wish; including on the above concepts; thank you for everything being done.

Dear Gov. Bush:

I am the proud parent of Bianca Ross (a 12th grader), who is a member of Miami Northwestern Senior High Community School's, PAVAC Drama magnet program under the leadership of Mr. Charlette Seward. We (the parents) are very proud that our children have an opportunity to partake in this once in a life time endeavor; that is, to attend and compete in the American High School Theatre Festival Award held in Edinburgh, Scotland. The parent club is doing fundraisers, and soliciting contributions from family community and acquaintances.  Mrs. Seward is captivating audiences with her shows -- The Amen Corner, Lion King and Ain't Misbehavin - and receiving donations for their performance.

Besides the Scotland trip, there are school fees, senior fees, drama fees that we are obligated pay.  We are hoping that the state can provide, embrace us with funds to decrease the cost of this trip. And, give us guidance and information on grants we can apply for. 

When you are visiting Miami again, come by Northwestern and see our show.  The publicity will help us a lot.

fees etc. Out of state tuition is three times this. We are currently running
about 83 percent of the national average for community college tuition/fees.
You may have noticed that California's fees were extremely low, currently
$11, and Davis proposes raising them to $24 a credit hour. Until a few years
ago they charged NO tuition, but I expect with their budget problems they
will soon be at the national average if not above.

As for state funding, we are currently providing $2,742 in GR and $322 in
Lottery per FTE for a total of $3,064 in state funds. Add to that $1,350 in
tuition and you get to approximately $4,400 per FTE. For comparison
purposes, that's 86 percent of total funding for SREB state community
college funds of approximately $5,400 per FTE. 

I have attached a slide in a MS Word document that gives you a five year
history of funding by fund source per FTE. You will note that we've actually
declined a bit recently in actual per FTE funding from all sources, because
our funds have not kept pace with our growth.

Let me know if you want more, of if you'd like to have a quick briefing on
all of this for your background information. Thanks again for your support.

David

Governor Bush:
 
Allow me to introduce myself.  I am Gary Scott, Pastor of Bridge Creek Baptist Church.  I am also a CPA, President of School Financial Services, which provides contract controller services to charter schools throughout the United States.  Finally, I am a member of the Holmes County School Board.  
 
First I want to thank you for coming to Bonifay last week.  I regret that I was unable to meet with you as I was number 50 and you got to 49.  Next time, I'll have to get up a bit earlier.
 
The message I wanted to deliver is simple:  First, thank you for your pro-life stance.  You had my support in both your campaigns for Governor.  In fact, I, along with several other pastors in Holmes County, took an ad in the local paper endorsing you and several other pro-life candidates.  Together, I hope we can make a difference in Florida for life.
 
Second, thank you for supporting charter schools.  It is far more than a cliche to proclaim that our children deserve good schools.  I am fortunate to be able to provide a service to those schools.   In an interesting side note, charter schools have created three full-time jobs in Bonifay.  We create jobs while improving education.  That is a winner by any measure.
 
My apoligies at the length of this email.  I know you are busy, but everyone enjoys a word of encouragement.
 
Thank you,
 
Gary Scott

Dear Governor Jeb,

            Hope all is well and that this New Year finds us more monies so that you can continue leading this great state of ours.  I wanted to drop a short email to ask you, as well as the other cabinet members, for your support for the Stump Pass Dredging and Beach Re-nourishment Project, which will be on your calendar this Tuesday, Jan. 28th. 

            Years ago my wife found the wonderful Palm Island Community, north of Boca Grande, where you and your parents have enjoyed the holidays. I have followed this proposed re-nourishment proposal closely, as it has always been a dream of mine to own my own beachfront house on the Gulf of Mexico like my father before me.  Well, I have purchased land but have not been given permits because of the proposed project.   No project... no permits w/out a lengthy fight. That is my selfish reason for asking for your support, but I'm told the Lemon Bay eco-system would greatly benefit from the project. 

            Not wanting to take up too much of your time, the experts will be there this Tuesday to explain.   Again, I just wanted to express my thoughts and ask for your sincere consideration for this worthy project.   Wogie Badcock III, WS Badcock Corp. Mulberry, Fl 33860

PS.  Our Company just made our first payment to the Corporate Tax Credit Scholarship Program.  Our First payment went to Fl School Choice Fund out of Tampa, Fl.  What a great program!

I am thankful for Gods Vision for at least they do have a place to go.  Heroin (opiate) abuse as well as benzos, and not to mention ETOH, are such hard diseases to recover from.  You really never do.  It is a life long process...and the saddest part, is I cannot say that I would never  suffer from an addiction such as opiates because it is rampant with some Drs.  It is my dream to open such a thing as a 1/2 way house to help recovering addicts have a place to go, as well as a safe place for homeless people just to stay for a while to get them off the streets.  Are there any grants available to get such a thing going?

Apparently the efforts in the Senate have been successful, as you know.  We are hoping to convince Speaker Hastert, among others, of the importance of the Alternative 6D "compromise solution" to the Modified Water Delivery project.  With all of the ecological and hydrological advances we have made since 1989, it seems obvious not to go with the best possible outcome for all South Floridians as well as for Florida Bay and Everglades National Park.

Am taking the liberty of fwding you a letter written by Wade Hopping to the FWS. You may have already seen it, but it puts the feelings of the majority of your boating constituents into proper perspective.

Folks are ready to take to the streets because they still see inaction from your office, Colleen Castille, and are in fear that the remarks made by the Commissioners to SMC were just empty words.

Can we expect a strong action from our State Government, or can we assume that our lives have been permanently altered with no remedy available?

P.S. - this issue is not the only one - the State DEP is looking to criminalize the act of "trespassing" on State owned barrier islands - in spite of their statements, over the last year, that they want to "....work with resource users." That line is getting old, and there is no faith in our resource management at this point.

This is a wonderful step in the right direction and I can see how a child like Caity has much more potential for success with the proposed accommodations related to visuals and yet I do not see enough in the proposed accommodations for a young man like Scott who is hearing impaired, and other students like Scott.  In that Caity needs a visual foundation for her understanding of the abstract, Scott needs an interpreter for the variations in our language for which there is only one sign.   Again thank you for listening and for caring about all the children and their success,  the proposed accommodations are headed in the right direction and it can be done without changing the standards of the test....Marianne Bryant

Dear Governor Bush: Well Caity met our new state rep today, (he is the
former sheriff from Citrus county and very nice and caring individual.).
We were there on behalf of FCAT accomodations, with another wonderful
young man, Scott Babiock, from Citrus. Caity was the third grade rep
and Scott, the junior rep, who has a very high GPA, he is hearing
impaired and can't pass the FCAT without an interpreter. I was there to
show Caity needs the visual foundation to do abstract thinking and gave
several examples of how we problem solved and also problems that arise
in directions and rules, etc and how these are made concrete and
visual. Mr. Dean had never met an autistic child before, she sat for
over an hour at a conference table with several adults and only
questioned the word retained. She then announced that we were all there
to help her and Scott and even attempted some sign language for Scott.
I told the group that Caity had a new skill we discovered last night by
accident. If you give Caity a day and month, she will tell you all of
the dates in that month, for instance, "name all the dates for Tuesday
in November" and she does it. She just thinks differently than all of
us. She is still very involved with her president's card and now knows
all the vice presidents that were under all the presidents that she
names. She loves the presidents and yesterday in the car, she had an
old Time Magazine and wanted to know why John Kennedy had crutches in
the picture. Anyway, she also asked me why God put her here and I told
her to teach us about autism and she was very pleased at the thought of
being a teacher and I told her she taught her teachers too, and today a
state representative, who said he was going to visit you and mention
Caityand Scott, in case he does visit you, she is the same Caity that I
have been writing to you about, and yes, she is constantly teaching
everyone about autism. As I understand it, there will be many autistic
children at the capital on February 18th. to meet their
representatives. I am not sure if we will be there or not, that would
be a long day and we might have homework and a day's school work to
make up. but you might enjoy meeting some of the children. God Bless
you and thank you for listening...Marianne and Caity

Dear Mr. Denman:

It should be noted that the DOC Inspector General's office did nothing towards investigating the allegations of the Wardens personal threats towards Daymond, when we notified the DOC I G of these threats, back in August, several months before the actual setup occurred. 

They did send someone to talk to Daymond after the infraction occurred, but as you know, no one questions the validity of the word of an officer.  

We feel that the DOC Inspector General's did not do anything to try to deter these threats from happening, and therefore we feel another outside entity needs to conduct the investigation, such as the State Inspector General.

We also have on record one morning very early in August, Daymond was on his cot studying when an officer come over to him and accused him of "gunning" a female officer and he said was going to write him up for it.  The officer instructed him to put his things in a green bag.  When Daymond complied with his requests he dumped them out on the bed and said to Daymond, "Naw, I was just kidding, and walked away."  This was reported to the State Classification officer by Sasha Ross-attorney, along with other concerns about the unjustified abusive treatment of Daymond at Washington C I, and the fear for Daymond's safety.

Daymond's lawyers have each written a letter regarding Daymond's weapons charge and treatment.  I would like a copy of those letters to go to the office that is investigating this allegation of false charges and irregularity of search.

What is the address and the person that these needs to be addressed?

Governor Bush, thanks for meeting with the community college presidents on January 14.  We greatly appreciate the fact that you understand that the unfunded enrollments of 2001-2001 and 2002-2003 have created severe problems for community colleges that are unlike those of PreK-12 and the universities who have had their enrollment growth funded.
 
I am also pleased that you are willing to have have of the $28 million for matching diverted to scholarship matching.  In a county like Polk where 40% of the families qualify for food stamps, we need to get our scholarship donations matched in order to admit more students.
 
Finally, I want you to know that I have sent you a letter to recommend Judge Michael Raiden for the Second District Court of Appeals.

Subject: Second DCA Appointment: Alan DeSerio

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I wanted to take a moment to recommend your appointment of Alan DeSerio to the Second District Court of Appeal. I understand that you are interviewing Mr. DeSerio on Saturday, February 8th in Miami.

 

I practiced law with Mr. DeSerio for almost seven years. Mr. DeSerio is an extremely intelligent individual with strong morals and high personal integrity. He is highly dedicated to the welfare of our community, volunteering time to the needs of the homeless and to local church and community projects. 

 

Mr. DeSerio is immensely experienced with the appellate process. After having been admitted to the bar in 1972 and serving as Assistant State Attorney, he has been counsel of record in over 150 reported appellate opinions and additional unreported appellate opinions. In this time, Mr. DeSerio has practiced as appellate counsel both with the State of Florida Department of Transportation and in private practice.

 

Mr. DeSerio is also objective in critical decision-making. He has authored chapters in legal publications, such as the nationally recognized Nichols on Eminent Domain and The Florida Bar’s Florida Eminent Domain Practice and Procedure Manual. He has developed his skills as a respected mediator. He has served as Program Co-Chair and Program Editor in the development and presentation of eminent domain seminars at the Florida Conference of Circuit Court Judges.

 

These positive attributes make Mr. DeSerio uniquely qualified to serve our state as an appellate judge, and I commend his candidacy to you.

 

Once again, it was a pleasure meeting you this past November at the Family First dinner. By the way, Eli Ferrera contacted me and I plan to follow up with her to apply to the 13th Judicial Circuit JNC later this year when the openings arise. 

Very truly yours,

Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you once again for your time last December, I truly appreciated it.

I wanted to bring you up to date on a couple of things:

The Governing Board is now turning its attention to the FY03 budget.  Our
tentative budget for this year is well in excess of $800m.  We are
establishing budget priorities within existing millage rates.  I have made
it clear that under my tenure there will be no new positions and the agency
will focus on more efficient and accountable government.  Position
reductions and reduction or elimination of unnecessary programs will also be
a central focus.  Of course, restoring the Everglades ecosystem is my top
environmental priority.  Your commitment to the Everglades, as evidenced by
your budget proposal, is of paramount importance.

I also want to update you on what is perhaps one of the most critical
initiatives effecting the Everglades; Phosphorus Standard Rulemaking by the
Environmental Regulation Commission.

I know that agricultural stakeholders have spoken to you about this rule in
the recent past, and as always, the environmental community stakeholders are
pulling in the other direction.  I believe the truly important issues are:

1.	The rule must be technically viable.  In other words, must have the tech
available to achieve the standard.

2.	Economic feasibility, the economic impacts of meeting any one standard
must be taken into consideration.

3.	The standard must not render the District in violation when it comes into
effect.

Governor, hang in there.  I know this upcoming legislative session will be
quite challenging.  You remain in my prayers.

Fondest personal regards,

Trudi

Subject: Southeast Volusia Hospital Board

Hon. Governor Bush

I would like to suggest why my application for appointment to the Southeast Volusia Hospital District Board should not be negatively affected by a strict interpretation of the Enabling Act's residency requirements as follows:

"Two commissioners shall be residents of New Smyrna Beach, two commissioners shall be residents of the City of Edgewater, one commissioner shall be a resident of Oak Hill, and two commissioners shall be residents of the unincorporated area of the hospital district."

I believe the residency requirement was designed to give residents of the three cities and unincorporated area of the hospital district a more direct voice through your appointees to the Hospital District. 

While I currently reside in New Smyrna Beach, my medical office is located in Edgewater. This gives me the unique opportunity to discuss health care issues and the hospital personally with hundreds of Edgewater residents a month. While I also have a home under construction in Edgewater, my ability to represent, for you, the citizens of Edgewater would not be enhanced by moving.

The Act also states:

"Commissioners shall have business, professional, or personal experience useful for service as a commissioner."

I believe being a female doctor practicing in Edgewater, admitting patients to Bert Fish Hospital, being a former employee of the Hospital and talking daily about health care issues with residents of Edgewater, provides that "personal experience useful for service as a commissioner."

Finally, if you believe I am otherwise the best qualified candidate to serve as your Edgewater commissioner, you may be able to "liberally construe" the Act if you believe my professional service to Edgewater citizens would allow me to "accomplish the work authorized" as follows:

"Section 20. It is intended that the provisions of this act shall be liberally construed for accomplishing the work authorized and provided for or intended to be and provided for this act."

Governor, I believe I am uniquely qualified to "accomplish the work authorized" for the citizens of Edgewater as your commissioner on the hospital district board.


Sincerely,


Dr Susan Hole Ltc USAR

However, in order to calculate real numbers, I need to understand the formula that will be used to determine average district class size, taking into account all the variables of removing ESE, IB, dual enrollment, etc.  I assume there is a formula for each level (Pre-K-3; 4-8; 9-12).

Dear Laura Branker,
Thank you for responding. Not to sound condescending but I was wondering why I haven't heard from him since his re-election. I know he is very busy and with email I am sure it can be a monster out of control at times. Gov. Bush has always been able to get me to the "right" people but there has been no follow through so we sit in the same issues with no answers for several years now.
Once again, I will look at this as a new opportunity to right some wrongs :) Thank you!
Sincerely,
Mary Pringle

When you came to Cape Coral you asked DCF "why would the Pringle's be
good enough to care for our children and not good enough for our money."
Have you ever gotten this answered? We haven't and continue to ask this
very question. The idea that after adopting seven special needs children
of which most are disabled that I would be forced to go back to work and
jeopardize the day to day special care of the children simply because
the state chooses to butt heads with Federal laws allowing support for
special needs adoptions is ludicrous and unjust to strengthen families
attitudes.
Just my opinion.

COMMENTARY
Stronger Families  By JEB BUSH

TALLAHASSEE -- Every year in this state, 80,000 children are born
without a
father in the home. Each year, there are 85,000 abortions, and 80,000
Florida marriages are dissolved. Today, almost 50,000 Florida children
are
under some kind of state supervision. Hundreds of thousands are not
receiving the child support they deserve.

Across the country, the numbers are so staggering, and the implications
so
bleak, that we can become numb to the human toll they exact. Adding one
more
social worker, one more government program, will never reverse the
trends
and convince people to care for each other. We must start first in our
own
homes.

The challenge for policymakers is how to help that happen. In Florida,
we
have identified three broad goals for the years ahead: reading,
diversifying
our economy, and strengthening families. We have linked the first two
goals
closely with the third.

In reading, our efforts will build on the public school accountability
reforms we've implemented that are already reflected in rising student
achievement. They will also reinforce the role of parents and families
in
nurturing a love of reading in our children, through adult literacy
programs
and helping parents support the instruction their kids are receiving at
school.

We're committed to the low-tax, business-friendly policies that have
been
the catalysts for the job growth in Florida. But that's more than just
good
business. Better jobs and higher wages will allow parents to better
provide
for their children and spend more time with them.

The fiscal challenges are very real. But this optimistic view of
stronger
families is also the most realistic view. Americans have always been
that
way, and that's who we must be today.

Mr. Bush is the governor of Florida.

With regard to Jennifer.  She is a fine individual; however, she has never

of your administration.

If we need a woman, how about Tillie Fowler.  Tillie, at least, has a very

As Chairman of the Flagler County Executive Committe, I ran up the flag

Com. Jennifer Carroll, would be the greatest addition to the executive
branch should YOU appoint her to succeed our great buddy Frank Brogan as
Lt. Governor of my native State.

The Flagler County folks ,without a single dissent, approved a tentative
resolution to ask you consider this successful, articulate, educated
(good looking)  classy lady  as our next Liutentant Governor to take the
place of the great loveable Frank Brogan.

Just the  o ther day I asked Jennifer Carroll is she is still black. Her
answwer was in the affirmative. I further asked if she was a woman.
Again, an affirmative response.

Gee ... what an asset for the people of Florida ... black and female ...
smart, educated, articulate (a great speaker),
known already statewide... whow!

Hey ... let's go for her nomination to be
the unique person she is ... a most acceptable replacement for our great

From this afternoon's newsletter, (Jeanne Allen) 
Center for Ed Reform:


* CHARTERS: With charters increasingly becoming a leading option for
parents, it's curious that some states and communities continue to impede
their progress.

Florida: Governor Jeb Bush unveiled his class reduction size plan.  The plan
complies with the class size reduction amendment that passed with a 52
percent majority in the 2002 election.  The proposal contains a number of
elements that provide each district the greatest possible flexibility,
equity and accountability.   Charter schools are a major component to
implementing the amendment.  As schools of choice, charters themselves are
not subject to class size reduction, but the proposal calls for an
elimination of the cap on the number of charter schools allowed in each
district.  This will give more children the ability to leave crowded public
schools and attend charters.  It's a win-win for everyone. 

Pennsylvania: Last week the Pennsylvania state department of education
rejected five of five cyber charter school applications.  Under new
provisions. cyber school proposals can only be approved by the state.
Resubmission to the department or appealing to the Charter School Appeals
Board is still an option for those applications that were denied.  As this
is the first round of charter school applications to come before
Pennsylvania's new leadership. these rejections are a likely indication of
its mindset towards the charter school movement.

Massachusetts:  Local governments and schools in the Bay state are targeting
charters to soften the budget cuts that are inevitable across the board.  A
Waltham elementary school principal "sent an email to families urging defeat
of a charter program.  In Framingham, homeowners got a letter with their tax
bill reminding them of the fiscal impact of a charter school that opened
last fall.  In North Adams and surrounding towns, some 400 people have
signed a petition against a charter school proposal," according to the
Boston Globe.

Subject:	Web-based Assessment Possible Pilot Sites

Shan,

Prior to the December 18 meeting with Jim Horne, Cornelia Orr and yourself 
(etc), a conference call was conducted.  Brewser Brown, from the Governor's 
office was on that call when we discussed the identification of interested 
districts to participate in a Pilot Study. A few of the districts that had 
members serving on the Blue Ribbon Task Force were initially contacted to 
solicit their interest and participation.  Escambia and Pinellas were two 
that immediately expressed an interest to participate.  

I have also researched the "Florida Study of Educational Technology 2002" and 
have highlighted the sections that most pertain to projects that have been 
conducted in these districts for their further consideration as Pilot Sites.

On pages 14 & 15 of that report, regarding projects conducted:

Student's mastery of standards and benchmarks are assessed using computers 
and that assessment provides teachers with immediate feedback on students' 
needs, enabling problems to be caught and solved at an early stage. (Broward) 
 

Wireless labs along with other technologies are being used as tools and 
integrated into all curriculum aspects of instruction. (Pinellas)   

Each of the district's 5 schools is equipped with mobile labs, consisting of 
laptops on carts and wireless connectivity devices, network printers, 
projectors, digital cameras, network switches and powerstrips. (Baker) 

Allowing students to check out wireless laptop computers for use in the 
classroom and at home...this allows the students to access the server 
containing their work and allowing them to access software and the Internet.  
This project is set up to determine the effectiveness of laptop portability, 
wireless connectivity and parent involvement. (Gilchrist) 

1:1 computer instruction available to students on a 24/7 time frame in a 
wireless environment. (Jefferson)   

Each laptop has wireless connectivity to the Internet and the district 
Intranet. (St. Lucie) 

Students can access Internet content and services from anywhere in the school 
using a mobile lab.  Students use this for research, word processing, 
creating web content, and monitoring their own academic progress. (St. Johns)

These are just a few of the districts and projects represented in the study.

 On page 12 of the  Study it is requested that there be "computer-based 
instruction to aid special education students..."and on page 13..."School 
districts recognize that various technologies are tools to accomplish 
learning tasks. ...and software to align exceptional student classroom 
instruction with regular education curriculum and FCAT." 

I'm hoping that this will be helpful, and certainly you can count on Michael 
& I to aid with any presentations to these and other districts to promote 
their participation in a Pilot Project.

The entire study can be viewed at 
http://www.doe.firn.edu/edtech/sr/fset/downloads/FSETReport.pdf

I'm really looking forward to attending one of the Regional Meetings next 
week in Tampa.  Hope to see you there!

Dear Governor Bush,

We're so HAPPY that things are moving along so quickly.  Have been in touch

Last week my Mike gave a few presentations at ATIA (Assistive Technology

Task Force Report with AT specialists and industry leaders from around the 
country and world!   They are requesting that we present the report at other 
conferences around the country.  These people were excited and envious at the 
same time because "WE" have a Governor that not only embraces technology and 
change, but is also an ADVOCATE for our kids!

Thanks again for your leadership and most importantly, your ability to care!

From the Heart,

It is probably a fair sample but there is a point that you need to
understand.  NAEP is only a sample and it is done anonymously and it does
not recognize or identify the individual student.  In other word what is
going on in the mind of the student and what is the motivation to actually
try hard on the test.  For example some students or maybe most students will
simply randomly select answers.  Since our FCAT has consequences our
students prepare for and take very seriously our test and our students who
are selected for the NAEP test make decide to just "blow thru" the NAEP
test.  It is something we need to think about. This has been the subject of
some debate by NAGB who is responsible for NAEP.

JEB, 

The Tribune printed the following letter in response to a (negative)
letter to the editor. I thought you might like to read it. (By the way,
Marie Johnson is my wife.)

Dear Editor: 

Bob Doran said Governor Bush is asking "...college students, state
employees, poor, medically needy..." to pay for the class-size amendment.

Doran didn't mention, of course, that it was the college students, state
employees, poor, medically needy, etc., who voted for the amendment. Did
these people expect someone else to pay for what they voted for? This is
a good example of the adage "A liberal is someone who'd give you the
shirt off someone else's back."


What we have here, I believe, is nothing but more liberal whining. Bush
won the election. McBride is a (Mc) bridesmaid. It's time to get over it
and help the governor resolve the problems that others (liberals) have
created.

	Governor Bush:
	Please see the attached internal memo on Delta's new low-cost
carrier.
	There will be 144 daily flights from the Northeast U.S. to Florida.
	This basically replaces Delta Express 737's with Boeing 757's.
	Good news for the State of Florida, as there is great potential for
growth.
	Please call me if you have any questions.

	Our thoughts and prayers are with your brother and this nation as
	he makes some tough decisions the next few weeks.

Subject:	Florida Kidcare

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing this letter seeking assistance from you and/or your staff.  I have been a full time viable resident of Florida for 18 years and have never sought any public assistance.  As of December 1st, I had no alternative than to file for Unemployment and have been actively pursuing a career in the Lee County Government or the State of Florida to provide the insurance benefits my family needs.
 
I have made application recently with the Florida Kidcare and Florida Healthy Kid program as I can no longer afford $453.00 per month for insurance coverage for my 2 girls.  I contacted the Kidcare program this morning only to find that they have not processed my application, however I was informed that because I have insurance in place at the time of application I would not qualify.  I informed them that I have to cancel the insurance at the end of this month rather than the end of March as indicated on the application.   I cannot be 6-8 weeks without any insurance to find out if I qualify or not.  Nor can I  keep my existing insurance if my family would like to eat!
 
I have exhausted my savings prior to filing for Unemployment as I was "too proud" to do so and with the bills piling up rapidly I had no other choice.  
 
I will continue to seek employment with the State of Florida, Lee County Government and larger civilian sector companies so that I will have the benefits that should be afforded to all Americans.
 
I now ask for intervention from you and/or your staff so that I may have my insurance for my children during this transition period.
 
Your consideration concerning this matter is greatly appreciated.
 
Respectfully,
Catherine C. DiBenedetti

BUSH'S DILEMMA 
by Congressman Lou Frey, Jr. 




President Bush had a chance in the State of the Union address to make his case regarding the necessity for attacking Saddam Hussein and his repressive government in Iraq. The President has been running into rough sledding over the last several weeks. The coalition that at one point had seemed so promising with France, Germany and Russia on our side has come apart. Chancellor Schroeder recently stated that Germany will not send troops and will not vote for a resolution for war. The President of France joined Germany in opposing war and has called for more inspections over a long period of time. The U.S. had asked for backup support from NATO and even this has been turned down. The new Turkish government has been ambivalent. The first indications were that we were going to be able to post massive troops along the Turkish-Iraqi border. The Turkish government backed off and indicated that only talks with the military about posting troops were going to be held and that no definitive decision had been made. Several months ago, I was in England and talked with some of the Labor Party members of Parliament about what England would do if there were no UN resolution or definitive proof of weapons of mass destruction. The members indicated that Prime Minister Tony Blair was out ahead of his party and support for the U.S. position was slipping.

This President is not one who lives or dies by polls, but he also has a great deal of common sense. Most people in this country do not like Saddam Hussein, his repressive regime or what he has done with chemical or biological weapons in the past. That is not the issue. Many people in the United States feel that even if he has such weapons, he isn't dumb enough to try and use them, as Iraq would be nothing but a desert. Furthermore, a great many Americans are looking for the smoking gun. The inspectors have not turned anything up so far and it appears that they will not in the near future. Saddam has had years to hide these weapons and the inspectors are doing nothing more than playing a game of "Hide n' Seek". Most Americans hoped that the President, as was done years ago at the United Nations during the Cuba missile crisis, would have shown a satellite photo or come up with definitive evidence that leaves no doubt about Saddam's evil intent. That did not happen in the State of the Union address. There are many good reasons why, if we have the intelligence, we are not able to use it. The biggest reason is not revealing our sources. But it's not good enough to just say, "we know". It's not good enough for the people in the United States, and its not good enough for our friends and potential allies abroad.

I am sure the President and his advisors are deeply frustrated. It appeared for a while that Saddam was on the run with countries in the Arab world looking for ways to get him out of Iraq. The pressure was building on Saddam and undoubtedly some serious thought was being given within Iraq to his leaving. However, it appears he has dodged another bullet and the pressure that was on him has dissipated as quickly as a gas balloon that is punctured. If this is a chess match, Saddam is several moves ahead of the United States and the pressure has now shifted to the United States to make a case or go it alone.

Let me admit that I am personally biased. I have great faith in the President's judgment and I have known some of the people who are involved in the process for over thirty years, especially the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense. These are bright, intelligent, honest, hard-nosed, common sense people. They are not bomb-throwers. They are not alarmists. They deeply feel there is a threat to our nation and that Saddam is just playing games. They don't want to take military action, but may be forced to take it if there is no other choice. I have no inside knowledge but believe there is confidential information that, if we all had, would cause us to back the President. Secretary Powell is going to present our case to the UN on February 5th. I hope this will "make the case" and unite the country. We don't want another Vietnam.

Dear Ms. Gay:
 
Your email of January 29 has been forwarded to this office for a response.  At present, the Florida Clean Indoor Air Act (FCIAA) permits no more than one-half of the total square footage of any single, enclosed indoor area be designated for smoking.  This requirement applies to government buildings and places of employment.  The person in charge may at his/her discretion choose to have a smokefree workplace.  For your review, I have attached a copy of the statute.
 
If you would like to make an official complaint regarding smoking at the courthouse, I will need the following information:
 
Name of public place (courthouse)
Mailing address
City, zip code
Nature of violation (i.e., smoking in areas not designated, unrestricted smoking, etc.)
Name of person in charge, if known
 
If  you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Your email concerning smoking within a government building has been referred to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

The Department of Health actually oversees the Florida Clean Indoor Air Act. This program has the authority to enforce the designation of smoking areas and the posting of signs. I have taken the liberty of forwarding your e-mail to Donna Arnold with FCIAA. You should hear from Ms. Arnold very soon.  Also, you can telephone her at 800-337-3742 or 850-245-4281.

Subject:	State Library and Archives

I read of the proposal to dismantle the State Library and Archives and was horrified that anyone would even consider such an idea.  I am a 6th generation Floridian and have a vested interested in the preservation and access to the records of the State.  I have personally done research in the State Archives of almost all of the Southern States.  Some states , Virginia and Georgia for example, have recently built very large new facilities with updated equipment for researchers.  The County of Knox, TN is building a large new History Center.
 
As it was, I was appalled at the under staffed,small cramped quarters that the State of Florida had provided for researchers and it was clear that this was already a low priority for the State. But to think that it would recieve even less attention was something I had not  imagined.  Florida is a very important State in the history of our nation, and has a very colorful and rich history which needs to be shared and made easily available to those who wish to work with the records and collections.  This idea is one which in the short run may save come costs, but in the long run would be a tragedy.  I urge you not to pursue this idea, the message that it sends is an uncultured and valueless one.

Dear Governor Jeb:
 
It has come to my attention that you may not reappoint Dick Browdy to the FBC due to term limits.
 
The purpose of this e-mail is to ask you to consider:
 
*       Mr. Browdy was appointed by you to the FBC 7/27/99.  His prior appointments by Governors Martinez and Chiles were to different Boards with different missions.
*       He is the only commissioner representing Northeast Florida.
*       He is recognized as one of our most effective and knowledgeable commissioners and demonstrates leadership on a regular and consistent basis.
 
I strongly believe Dick Browdy should be appointed as chairman when, or if, my good friend Raul L. Rodriguez decides to step down.

Gov. Bush,
 
After listening to yesterday's Cabinet discussion on beach renourishment, I thought you'd be interested in reading the special section that our Gannett regional newspapers produced in June. 
 
It provides a good overview of both the politics and the process behind beach renourishment.
It was pretty fascinating research.

Mr. Maloy is an embarrassment to everyone in Leon County and should have

Subject:	Nihipali Children in Fort Myers Florida


Sir,

I understand you have assigned someone to look into the matter involving the Nihipali children, in Fort Myers, Fl. The children are currently in DCF custody at a foster home, but may soon be sent to the biological father in Hawaii, as per a court order by Judge Isaac Anderson.  I am the great aunt to the children on the maternal side, and was the family placement for the children from September 2001 until December 2002.  The entire time I had the babies it was the assumption of all parties, (including DCF and the Guardian Ad Litem), that the father would not be an issue when it came time to place the children in a stable home environment. This assumption of all parties was because of the father's criminal history, pattern of abusive behavior toward family members, drug and alcohol abuse, lack of continued employment, he doesn't read or write, he's on welfare, and testimony of a 14 yr old stepdaughter, who stated she and her other sister were given drugs and alcohol by the father while in the home with him. (At the time they were 11 and 12 yrs old)! After hearing that statement in October, the Judge stated he would not place the children in such an environment, yet in January he ruled the children should be with the father. (I firmly believe the Judge did not remember and associate the 14yr old he'd  talked to in October to the case in January. (The children have different last names than their older sister). Since the October hearing the only change is that the children have been moved to a VERY LOVING long term home, and Mr. Nihipali has tested positive for THC on both UAs he's been given. I am devastated at what is happening here with these children. Mr Nihipali has been arrested 22 times, and has been the suspect in more cases. His daughter was taken from the home in 1997 due to drugs and alcohol. Yet Hawaii DCF say be completed a "drug class" so he is okay now. I beg to differ. He supplied drugs to young kids in 2000 and 2001, and is still testing positive.  Mr Nihipali is obviously scamming the system in Hawaii, (as he has done before).  My question is WHY does Florida have to accept such a home study. Don't we have higher standards than that?  The 2 14yr olds are now extremely disturbed children. One only reads at a 3rd or 4th grade level and has lots of problems in school, and the other one is a 14yr old drug addict who is currently in the custody of DJJ. (This really makes me sick because she was always an A student in all honors classes, and has so much potential). I know all of the facts about this case, and would be glad to answer and questions. There are so many people that are "up in arms" about this situation. We just don't know what else to do. NO ONE thinks these children should be placed in that environment, yet it appears time is slipping away and nothing is getting done about it.  I will be happy to answer any questions or concerns. My home number is (239) 283-7663, and my work number is (239) 477-1217. PLEASE HELP!!!!  Thank you for your time, and keep up the good work!!     

P.S. Kim and Kenny Dobson, the current foster parents, are great. The kids love them and the love is returned. They are so happy. I've know the Dobson's since they were teenagers. I would never have turned the children over to anyone else. Even so, we took several months to transition the children, so the final move was not at all traumatic for them. We love those children and have always kept their best interest in the forefront!!.

About Friday

-no $ amount actually set aside
 No "block" of $10B

-participating states would get a supplment that would be a small,
undisclosed percentage of their individual budgets for FY2002

-CMS staff estimate that if 30 states participated, the total amount of this
supplement would roughly be $10B. This is where the "10B" figure comes from
although Kathleen has since heard the estimate is closer to $8.5B.

-the total amount of that supplemental money would be distributed to states
over the first 5 years but it is expected that it would cover a full 10 year
period.  During the last 5 years, states must be budget neutral ie no
additional supplemental money and states must pay for program costs through
cost savings and new efficiences.

-the supplement is in addition to the base funding we currently receive.

-base funding takes into account "some" population growth.  The amount to
the supplement will not and again, it will be based on a % of our '02
Medicaid budget.

- the "%" value to be used was not/could not be disclosed

Positive points in the proposal:
-Flexibility
-base on an SCHIP model
-more focus on long term care needs

Gov. Bush,
 
The story about your relationship with the black community is just about done and it's looking pretty balanced.
 
I'd love to get some feedback from you on this story after it runs, off the record, so I can get a handle on your standards. I'm operating under the impression that you're more sensitive to biased stories than you are to being the subject of a tough story.
 
On  the record, I have to hit you up with a final story inquiry. I need your reaction - should you choose to react - to the results of my analysis of black voting patterns.
 
As you may recall, I checked county records for Florida voting precincts in which 80 percent or more of the registered voters were black on Nov. 5. There are about 225 and my numbers had you pulling votes from 2.09 percent of the registered voters in them. This was an all-time low for you in the three gubernatorial campaigns.
 
By the way, that was a funny joke about literacy and newspaper circulation at the budget press conference. I laughed.

Victor Epstein

While I am telling you how to run the State, I will make a suggestion should Lt. Governor Brogan leave for the FAU position.  Should you appoint a Lt. Governor, I would suggest you consider Lake County Commissioner Catherine Hanson and Rep. Gaston Cantens.  Either would be an excellent choice.

<PRE>Dear Gov Jeb Bush..Final details are not in yet, however, preliminary

budget to expand the local charter high school and basic renovation and 
upkeep may also be impossible.  Rated A plus last year with an enrollment of 
400 plus students. It is just getting started and has been very well accepted 
by the local community. If our local charter school is impacted, I have to 
assume others will be in the same situation. The traditional school system

Hi there, 
I am having difficulty getting the appointment with you. I am a little concerned about the urgency of time. If you are not, I'm okay to wait. I understand the rumor mill is heating up and we are already being told by schools that they will not be registering for summer and fall due to the FTE issue. I very much want to have a party line when these issues begin coming directly to me. I am meeting with Commissioner Horne next Tuesday at 2:00 (Feb. 5). If there is anyway to squeeze me in on either Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning, I will be up there. 

Thanks for being accessible - I really appreciate being able to email you.

Governor, 
Got the message from Pat regarding our increased enrollment. It was our intent to move from 12,000 to 18,000 enrollments. Also got the message loud and clear that you were not satisfied with this increase :). 

Tell me what kind of increase you want to see and I will do my best to make it happen. Our primary concern is quality. I know there is a desperate situation at hand and will do whatever it takes to help. 

Tell me what you want.

Hi Governor Bush

You first met our family at Epiphany when I asked you to visit the 4th grade that my daughter was in just before you moved to Tallahassee..recently we had a photo taken with you and the President when you were here for Cuban Independence day and we met back stage...Hector arranged it.  Anyway, we are proud that our daughter Laura (and two classmates) won the honor of  representing  your state in the Future City Engineering Competition Feb 15-20 in Washington.  It would be great to win the finals!  If you are in Miami at Epiphany anytime soon, the 3 kids on the team would love to have a photo with you.  Only 20 states have qualified to go to Nationals, so a "photo Op" might make for good "educational" PR for the state.  If this perks your interest, please respond. This is very minor, but Epiphany is your parish when in Miami, so the kids would be thrilled!

Tax foe Fasano loses Senate post

By STEVE BOUSQUET, Times Staff Writer
(c) St. Petersburg Times
published January 30, 2003 

First-term Sen. Mike Fasano, an outspoken critic of higher taxes, lost his vice chairmanship Wednesday on a Senate committee that has the power to pass tax bills. 

Fasano, R-New Port Richey, was dropped from the Senate Finance & Tax Committee. 

A conservative ally of House Speaker Johnnie Byrd, R-Plant City, Fasano said Senate President Jim King called him on his cell phone and attributed the change to "my comments and my actions opposed to increased taxes." 

King's spokeswoman, Sarah Bascom, confirmed Fasano is no longer on the committee, but said she did not know why. She said the recent death of Sen. Howard Futch required the shifting of senators to other committees to preserve a partisan balance of Republicans and Democrats. 

"He could have made up an excuse but he didn't. He made it clear to me," Fasano said. 

Fasano, a former House member, was the only House Republican who voted last year to oppose a compromise between then-Senate President John McKay and then-House Speaker Tom Feeney to form a committee to study sales tax exemptions. The committee, a face-saving step, was subsequently struck down by the state Supreme Court. 

Fasano said he thought the catalyst for King's decision probably was tied to Fasano's comments during the Finance and Tax Committee's workshop on Jan. 16, when a list of revenue options, which Byrd has called the "Senate tax plan," was first circulated. Fasano said committee Chairman Skip Campbell asked if anyone had anything to add. 

"I raised my hand and asked if we could take items off the list," Fasano said.

"You would think that if you lead the nation on a case-by-case basis of death row commutations, it might be just a bit of a tip to the political intelligentsia that something is rotten."  Daniel Ruth
COMMENT: The key word here is "intelligentsia."   Need I say more!  How do you sleep at night?
=============================================================
Florida Strives To Regain The Title In Death Row Follies
DANIEL RUTH 
Published: Jan 29, 2003 

Typical, typical, typical that an Illinois politician would cheat so flagrantly to become No. 1 at something. 
When Gov. George Ryan commuted the sentences of all 167 Illinois death row inmates in his waning hours in office, obviously his state vaulted way past Florida as the most screwed-up capital punishment place in the country. 
That was so unfair. Especially considering Florida had achieved its prior status as the national leader in death row commutations the old- fashioned way - by botching one case at a time. 
Without the benefit of a blanket clemency granted by a departing governor, Florida has released 25 formerly condemned men after discovering evidence that questioned their guilt. 
Last week Rudolph Holton was released from Union Correctional Institution, where he had spent 16 years on death row for a murder conviction won because of dubious witnesses and police incompetence. 
Sixteen years in a cage. 
We May Never Know 
How close did Florida come to executing a man even his former prosecutor, Joe Episcopo, now believes is innocent? We may never know. 
Holton was exonerated largely on evidence that didn't exist at his original trial in 1986. Hair found in the murder victim's mouth, purported to be Holton's, was proved to be that of the 17-year-old victim, Katrina Ann Graddy. 
You would think that if you lead the nation on a case-by-case basis of death row commutations, it might be just a bit of a tip to the political intelligentsia that something is rotten. 
Who could possibly blame Gov. Jeb Bush, an ardent pro-life pol, if he ordered a moratorium on future executions until the state is sure it is killing the right people? 
If ever there was a ``duh'' moment, this would have to be it. 
Yet Bush has proposed eliminating state money for lawyers representing death row inmates, arguing that taxpayers would save $4 million a year. 
Talk about being penny-wise and body bag foolish! 
Instead of doing everything possible to ensure that if the state is going to kill somebody, it might be sort of a neat idea if the person actually deserves to die, Bush has decided to save a few bucks by undermining the ability of a prisoner to petition the courts. 
Think of it this way: Florida's $4 million in funding for capital punishment cases applies to 365 condemned inmates, pretty much a bargain-basement figure to start. By contrast, Jeb Bush blew $1 million just to celebrate his second inauguration. Yes, he spent private money in that case, but the comparison remains. 
Abe Bonowitz, who leads Floridians For Alternatives to the Death Penalty, argues that eliminating funding for death row legal representation probably would lead to increased costs down the road and a higher probability of executing innocent people. 
``Maybe one of these days somebody will hit Governor Bush up aside the head,'' Bonowitz said, noting that Ryan, once a fervent death penalty proponent, changed his views after signing a death warrant for a prisoner later proven innocent. 
At the moment, Bonowitz estimated, Florida has at least 10 of 365 death row cases in which there are ``serious questions of guilt, and there may be more.'' 
Assuming Bonowitz may be on to something, wouldn't that make the case for a moratorium on executions until the state can figure out a way to ensure it is killing, you know, guilty people? 
Instead, Bush wants to speed the appeals process - but without funding legal representation for the condemned. 
No Technicalities 
``The bottom line is there hasn't been anyone found innocent on death row,'' blathered state Sen. Victor Crist, R-Last Rites. ``There have been people released on [legal] technicalities.'' 
Holton wasn't released from death row on a ``technicality.'' New evidence exonerated him, along with the admission by witnesses that they lied. 
Frank Lee Smith was another man cleared of a murder charge after DNA evidence proved his innocence. But Smith wasn't released from prison because of some legal mumbo-jumbo, either. No sir. 
After 14 years waiting for a governor to kill him, Smith died in his cell. 
Does cancer qualify as flouting justice with a ``legal technicality''?

Subject:	Lt. Governor Recommendation for your consideration

Dear Governor Bush:

It is with mixed emotions that I anticipate Lt. Governor Brogan becoming
the head of FAU. His common sense leadership approach to education,
eschewing the political correctness mantras now endemic in higher
education, is direly needed on the University scene in this state.
However, he will be sorely missed as your heir apparent to become
Governor in four years; a concern we all share.

One person whom I believe will meet this need of electability and serve
you well during the remainder of your term is Jennifer Carroll. My
enquiries indicate that in addition to being articulate, charismatic,
poised, and a lovely lady, she has demonstrated political and leadership
abilities that reflected exceptionally well on her in her recent bid for
Congress against an entrenched leftist. She demonstrated under fire that
her political philosophy is clearly to the right of center and well
within the conservative mainstream in Florida.
Seldom has a nominee losing a general election in a high profile race
remained in such high esteem, and this certainly bodes well for her
political future.The fact that she has served in the Navy as a Lt.
Commander, I submit, is also a plus.

Jennifer, appointed as your Lt. Governor, can be considered essentially
in two ways: A bold move by you in appointing a conservative,
charismatic, poised,black and electable woman to be groomed to succeed
you and carry on your conservatively oriented reforms, or as a move to
pander to feminists and blacks. I submit that the overwhelming response
will be that you are grooming a worthy successor once she receives
statewide exposure. I sincerely hope you will seriously consider
Jennifer Carroll to be a worthy successor to Frank Brogan when he is
appointed to head FAU tomorrow.

 Subject: Military Pay Raise 
 
 On 12 Nov, Ms Cindy Williams (from Laverne and Shirley TV show) wrote a
piece for the Washington Times, denouncing the pay raise(s) coming
servicemembers' way this year -- citing that the stated 13% wage was more
than they deserve. A young airman from Hill AFB responds to her article
below. He ought to  get a bonus for this! 

"Ms Williams: 
 
 I just had the pleasure of reading your column, "Our GIs earn enough" and
I am a bit confused. Frankly, I'm wondering where this vaunted overpayment
is going, because as far as I can tell, it disappears every month between
DFAS (The Defense Finance and Accounting Service) and my bank account.
Checking  my latest leave and earnings statement (LES), I see that I make
$1,117.80 before taxes. After taxes, I take home $874.20. When I run that
through Windows' Calculator, I come up with an annual salary of $13,413.60
before  taxes, and $10,490.40 after. 
 I work in the Air Force Network Control Center (AFNCC), where I am part of
 the team responsible for the administration of a 5,000-host computer 
network. I am involved with infrastructure segments, specifically with
Cisco Systems equipment. A quick check under jobs for Network Technicians
in the Washington, D.C. area reveals a position in my career field, 
requiring three years experience with my job. Amazingly, this job does NOT
pay $13,413.60 a year, nor does it pay less than this. No, this job is
being offered at $70,000 to $80,000 per annum. I'm sure you can draw the
obvious conclusions. 
 Also, you tout increases to Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic
Allowance for Subsistence (housing and food allowances, respectively) as
being a further boon to an already overcompensated force. Again, I'm
curious as to 
 where this money has gone, as BAH and BAS were both slashed 
15% in the Hill AFB area effective in January 00. 
 Given the tenor of your column, I would assume that you have NEVER had the 
pleasure of serving your country in her armed forces. Before you take it
upon yourself to once more castigate congressional and DOD leadership for 
attempting to get the families in the military's lowest pay brackets off
AFDC, WIC, and food stamps, I suggest that you join a group of deploying
soldiers headed for AFGHANISTAN, I leave the choice of service branch up to
you. Whatever choice you make, though, opt for the SIX month rotation: it
will guarantee you the longest possible time away from your family and
friends, thus giving you full "deployment experience."  As your group
prepares to board the plane, make sure to note the spouses  and children
who are saying good-bye to their loved ones. Also take care to note that
several families are still unsure of how they'll be able to make 
 ends meet while the primary breadwinner is gone -- obviously they've been
squandering the vast piles of cash the DOD has been giving them. 
 Try to deploy over a major holiday; Christmas and Thanksgiving are
perennial favorites. And when you're actually over there, sitting in a DFP
(Defensive Fire 
 Position, the modern-day foxhole), shivering against the cold desert
night; and the flight sergeant tells you that there aren't enough people on
shift to relieve you for chow, remember this: trade whatever MRE
(meal-ready-to-eat) you manage to get for the tuna noodle casserole or
cheese tortellini, and add Tabasco to everything. This gives some flavor. 
 Talk to your loved ones as often as you are permitted; it won't nearly be
long enough or often enough, but take what you can get and be thankful for
it. You may have picked up on the fact that I disagree with most of the
points you present in your op-ed piece. 
 But, tomorrow from KABUL, I will defend to the death your right to say it.
 You see, I am an American fighting man, a guarantor of your First
Amendment rights and every other right you cherish. On a daily basis, my
brother and sister soldiers worldwide ensure that you and people like you
can thumb your collective nose at us, all on a salary that is nothing short
of pitiful and under conditions that would make most people cringe. 
 We hemorrhage our best and brightest into the private sector because we
can't offer the stability and pay of civilian companies. And you, Ms
Williams, have the gall to say that we make more than we deserve? Rubbish!

 IF YOU AGREE, PLEASE PASS THIS ALONG TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AND
SHOW OUR SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN FIGHTING MEN AND WOMEN. THANK YOU.

Got it (let me know if I'm doing this right or not). Governor Bush, on Behalf of the Osceola County Boys and Girls Clubs Board of Directors we would like to invite you to be our keynote speaker at this summers fund raising dinner. Will Saturday September 6th work for you in Kissimmee at a venue similar to the Gaylord Palms, Orlando Hyatt or new Osceola Heritage park complex ? If that date does not work for you, it is early enough in the scheduling process to allow for a high level of scheduling flexibility. Please let me know if you need this in writing  and/or what questions you and/or your staff need answered. We prefer a Friday or Saturday evening. I look forward to your participating in a great event to help a lot of our kids. Kind Regards, Jay Wheeler    Osceola County School Board & Vice Chairman Osceola Boys and Girls Clubs Board of Directors.

Instead of asking for money. I'd prefer to raise it on our own. The point is having you as the speaker at a fund raising dinner will simply make it easier to get participation. As for "making the ask", I am certain the time and beauracracy associated with it in the context of state Govt. would be cumbersome & time consuming. I already know how to raise money in Central FL and am certain a fund raiser (w/your participation) could raise a ton of money faster with no strings attached and would not be another burden on sources of tax dollars. I'd rather use tax dollars for construction and renovation of schools. I hope this provides clarification. Once more can you join us for a Friday or Saturday this summer in Osceola County to help us raise some PRIVATE money for kids ? Let me know if you have any questions. JW

Governor, it was very kind of you to promote Boys and Girls Clubs at your inaugural this past week. The book collection was great too. In addition to being an Osceola School Board member I am also Vice Chairman of the Osceola Boys and Girls Clubs Board of Directors. In the past two years we have started two new programs at Middle Schools at one School the first year of operation proved to be the first time in 8 yrs that School had NO pregnancies. Books are great, but money is what we really need. We can get a program serving 100 kids daily up for just under 80K for the School yr and about 110K yr round. We target Schools with over 50% of the students on free and reduced lunches, that allows us to give the kids a snack too at NC-we piggyback on the USDA grant already in place for the meals. We are planning a summer dinner fund raiser. If you would be willing to be the featured speaker at an event it would be a great hook for fund raising. Is there a Friday or Saturday night this summer that you could make yourself available to join us so we can raise badly needed funds for our kids ? Kind Regards, Jay Wheeler/Osceola County School Board-District One

Subject: Talking Points


I know your colleagues are working feverishly to prepare talking points for you for tomorrow’s 3:30 p.m. press conference, drafting a press release and preparing comments for your 5 p.m. AACCLA speech.  Although I’ve talked to several of your colleagues about the press conference and the speech, I have not yet had a chance to see the final approvals.  I thought it might be helpful to you and your colleagues if I could put my suggested talking points for you for the press conference in writing.  They are as follows:
 
1.	As the Governor, I am delighted that Mayor Penelas, Mayor Diaz, Mayor Slesnick, Mayor Dermer, Commissioner Diaz and Commissioner Winton have (i) been working in a very cooperative and efficient manner with my designee Chuck Cobb to create a Memorandum of Understanding for hosting the Ministerial / Americas Business Forum (ABF), (ii) have selected a prominent Board of Directors for this task, (iii) have selected my long-time colleague Armando Codina to be the President of the ABF and (iv) have selected Luis Lauredo to be the Executive Director of the Ministerial and ABF.  You have accomplished a lot in a short time, and I am very appreciative of your efforts. 

2.	As the Governor, I am pleased to announce this prestigious Board consisting of all of South Florida’s former U.S. Ambassadors, most of South Florida’s leading international business executives, several of South Florida’s top university and college presidents and other leading internationalists in this community.  I am very pleased that the mayors and commissioners have agreed on such a prestigious Board.  Good job. 

3.	As the Governor, I am confident this Board, with the active involvement of the mayors, commissioners, Chuck Cobb, Armando Codina, Luis Lauredo and other community leaders, and the assistance of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, Beacon Council, Enterprise Florida and other organization and community leaders, is going to successfully host this Ministerial and ABF just like it has done many times in the past in hosting super bowls, national Republican and Democratic Conventions and various international conferences. 

4.	As Governor, I am pleased to announce the dates for the FTAA Trade Ministerial and ABF.  The meeting of trade ministers will be held on November 20-21 and the ABF will take place during the week of Monday, November 17, overlapping with the Ministerial.  The decision on the dates for the Miami meeting was made by the United States Trade Representative in Washington D.C. and coordinated with the government of Brazil, which co-chairs the FTAA negotiations with the U.S. 

5.	As Governor, I am going to be recommending a modest contribution of state funds for hosting the Ministerial and ABF during the next very tight budget year, as I am looking to the local communities to fund a high percentage of this important event just like Miami normally does in the type of events mentioned above. 

6.	As Governor, I plan to be actively involved to bring the FTAA Secretariat to Miami.  As I have stated previously, diversifying Florida’s economy is one of my three highest priorities for the next four years and obtaining the Secretariat for Florida and Miami in order that it can be the Brussels of the Western Hemisphere is precisely the type of economic diversification for which I am hopeful.  As I also stated before, I plan to spend a high percentage of my time during the next four years in South Florida in order that I will have sufficient time for this and other South Florida initiatives. 

7.	As Governor, one of my highest priorities will be to convince federal officials in the Administration and Congress that the U.S. should have one candidate for Secretariat of the FTAA in a fashion similar to how the U.S. selects one candidate to host the Olympic games or other international events.  Our country has learned long ago in Olympic games and other site selection processes, that we are only effective if we “have one horse in the race.” 
 
I am confident your colleagues will have most of the above points in your approved talking points, but I thought it might be productive for me to reemphasize these points to you.  All of the above seven points are important, but I think #7 above (the U.S. “having one horse in the race”) is the most critical of all.
 
Thank you again for making this effort such a high priority.  I hope I have a chance to see you for a few minutes before the 3:30 p.m. press conference.

Subject:	prison reform

Dear Governor Bush:

I met today with a group of mothers that have young adults sons in adult prison.  Our first topic of conversation was the disparity of sentencing lengths from one case to another, especially of first time offenders that were under the age of 21 being sentenced adult. The same offense could get probation or 20 years.  So much depended on the judge, or the legal system, not the offense.  The fairness of "equality under the law" is missing.

The stories of problems of medical neglect (one mother has a son that was in the same room as the inmate that was a Butler CI, that had complained of agonizing pain for three days which was left untreated and died).  We all have stories of harassment by cocky officers, that took it upon themselves to set up inmates with DRs, from planting marijuana under the bed to my son who was set up on first an assault charge and them and a weapons charge. We all have stories of sons or inmates being beaten and physically abused.  Some stories were about inmates being raped, or inflicting physical injury on other inmates, and some of officers and guards beating or inflicting injury on inmates.  We all agreed that there is no due process rights for the incarcerated.  We all agreed that the grievance process is an empty sham.  We all knew the end story of a grievance being written, and rubber stamped denied, without any real review.  The problems of each institution being ran with so much autonomy, that no one is regulating them, was lamented as state responsibility being shirked.  This was allowing extremities of treatment of inmates.

We told of the heartache of having first time DUI offenders doing heavier sentences than violent offenders that set out to do a crime.  

We talked about the lack of available educational and vocational programs.  One of the sons has had no availability of the GED programs.  He went in at 19 and is now 25.  His DUI ended the lives of two persons and has left him crippled for life. He lives in pain.  The DOC doctors will not prescribe the medication that is most effective, because it is not on the list.  The pain has not allowed him to go to school, that and the lack of assistive technology. 

We fear for our sons to return to society, not because they are bad people but because their lives have been thwarted by the policies of being dehumanized and of punishment, with no rehabilitation opportunities and no job skill options.  The adjustment from having ten or more years of their lives wasted. The adjustment to society will be very difficult because of the hostile, oppressive conditions that they have been subjected.  They sometimes have been subjected to inhumane treatment, that would be illegal if applied to animals.

We shared the problems of having to support the exorbitant phone call rate.  The institution has a significant shortage of supplies, of everything from toilet paper to clothing.  

In a DOC hospital setting, one mother had the unusual privilege of getting to eat an inmate's tray of food.  She indicated the she would have liked for you to have tried to have eaten it.  We all felt that we are having to subsidize the food rationing with money from home to go to the canteen.  We felt that if we were going to have to provide food for them, that we should not have to be scalped by the outrageous prices that are being charged.  

As a group we feel that we are being punished for our sons accidents by the manner that we are treated by the Institutions. If we show concern for C. I's wrong doings they harass, pressure, and penalize our sons.  In our case they have taken our visitation rights away, in retaliation of our allegations of their corruption of setting our son up with a weapons charge. 

We feel that there is no person in Tallahassee that has given us any help with questions about regulations, or to talk to about the corruption that we have encountered in different institutions.  The Prison liaison acts like a buffer for the prison system, she is equivalent to being sent to a dead letter file.  We have no liaison to act in our inmates interest. 

We will meet again, and next time we will have more information and meet with more parents and friends, and we will unite with other organizations that want reform.  We will start to talk to representatives about the need for changes.  We will tell the citizens in Florida the truth about the expensive failure of our prison system policies. 

Our children's lives are being damaged.  We have to do something. 
Governor Bush, you need to do something.

Jeb,

You know Peter but what you may not know is that he is interested in serving you in a more significant capacity.   

I do not need to tell you of the assets Peter would be able to bring to your administration, but I will any ways.   

Peter has been in FL politics longer than anybody I know.   He knows all the history and all the players of State government.   He has an excellent legal mind and he can be very creative in coming up with solutions that will work and be acceptable.   He was invaluable to Ileana when we faced Magda Montial Davis by doing some excellent research work to help us see who was opposing us.    Which leads me to his loyalty.   Peter is the most loyal, discreet patriotic American I know.   When I tell him not to repeat something, I do not have to worry about it.   He will not repeat it ever.   Additionally, when a decision is made after a lot of back and forth over an issue, Peter is a team player and he will move forward with the decision.  No trouble, low maintenance.....     He is the greatest!   Below is his resume.   I hope you will be able to consider him for a suitable position in your administration.   Peter's numbers are (O) 850-488-0974, (H)850-514-0666.

I understand things are getting difficult in Tallahassee, the State Senate and Gallagher.  I hope you follow your agenda and plans.

You are doing a great job and remember, "Estamos Ganando".

Dear Governor,

Pace Center for Girls is a prevention program that works.  Prevention programs from other states come to Pace to learn about the Pace program so that they may implement the Pace structure in their program.  To take away the funding of a prevention program and put it in building prisons is egregious.  I strongly support Pace Center for Girls.  Do not take away their funding.  Our children are in enough trouble as it is in this state, do not let it become even worse.

Subject: DCF investigation


Dear Sir:
 
Thank you for contacting DCF for me and having them do an in depth investigation.  Unfortunately, the caseworker (Susan Klatt) didn't find anything to support the fact that Marisa's father (Kenneth Salyers) has mishandled her and has shaken her.  I want you to know that Susan let me know how much she put into this investigation and how they usually don't do that.  Please know that I am grateful that she did.  Also know that Susan presented her findings in court very well (being her first time in court).  So again, thank you.
 
Of course, I realize that without witnesses there isn't much anyone can do.  And from what I've read about child abuse and shaken baby syndrome there usually isn't a previous history of abuse for those who just "lost it" when the baby was crying.  Here's the point Sir, I SAW him shake her, and I SAW him squeeze her chest several times (only when she was crying).  I cannot be told that it didn't happen and I cannot feel safe leaving Marisa in his care without supervision.
 
On December 9, 2002, I had filed a petition for a temporary injunction, we had the hearing on January 24, 2003 and with the limited time allowed and lack of proof, the judge dismissed the injunction.  There is no way that I can come to peace with having to hand Marisa over to Kenneth unsupervised.  Kenneth sat in court and lied about the events of the day (November 24, 2002) when he shook Marisa.  How do I, as a mother, accept the fact that he took an oath to tell the truth and lied AND has shaken Marisa to be dismissed?  And how do I accept that this is the type of father Kenneth will be to our daughter?  What can I do?  Dianne Johnson (at DCF) told me that if Marisa came home hurt or with signs of abuse  - now I would know what to do.  I am asking you HOW DO I ACCEPT THAT?  Are you a father?  Would you just let someone get away with treating your child that way?  If you knew the truth and you were denied protection would you stop at nothing to ensure your child's safety?
 
I understand that Kenneth is Marisa's biological father, even though he wanted an abortion in January 2002, and now I can anticipate him fighting for custody of her.  I can't deny him visitation, this I know, but how do I get supervised visitation for my daughter - let someone else see what he is like with her (and it's going to take more than one visit I'm sure).  Ken's attorney won't accept supervised visits and I won't accept having to wait until Marisa is hurt for something to be done.  My attorney said that Ken knows people are watching him now that we've been through this and he won't mess up again.  But I tell you, I know Ken, I have witnessed his behavior and have seen his pattern.  Yes, maybe he will not hurt her right now, but it is only a matter of time.  Mark my words, 4 months is the longest I've ever seen him behave without some form of abuse.
 
The detective that was on the case told me I shouldn't be afraid of him.  WHY NOT?  He has told me that "looking back at my divorce, I would have rather gone to jail for shooting my ex-wife than give her my house".  And he has told me that he has people who owe him "favors" still.   -  And have witnessed his behavior.  You tell me Sir, why would the detective tell me I shouldn't be scared of Ken?  What is protecting me?  What is protecting my daughter?  NOTHING I tell you, nothing.  I went to court and told the truth, Ken went to court and lied - and who won?  Ken.  How does that happen?  I tell you, if you now tell me that I should have faith in our justice system I will have to tell you that from my experience our justice system protects the guilty - so long as you have a good attorney.
 
Is there an appeal that can be filed?  Is there a way to get supervised visits?  Is there a way to prove his lies with a poloygraph test (especially if he is a pathological liar would he fail)?  I ask you because now I don't trust attorney's and I don't trust judges.  You are basically my last resort.  Please guide me in the right direction.  Please don't let our daughter have to wait until its too late.
 
Sincerely,
Gina Campala

Great work, Jeb, on trying to face down the feds on the excessive manatee
rules. Everyone was tricked, frankly, by false info, and now it's time to
straighten things out. Manatees are flourishing as never before, under
traditional, existing management. Your letter was superb.

Secondly, I don't think you realize that your staff in preparing the budget
gutted $600,000 in artificial reef funds that involve federal matching funds
and license fees and this has been a standard program every year with huge,
huge benefits for the state. The money will be there, it can't be diverted
really. Fix?

Lastly, a joint task force I was on has urgent recommendations to update the
FWC budget, including removing the shore exemption for resident anglers,
something no other state has and a loophole that makes no sense. My coming
Openers column is about this and I know it's your favorite reading. Help?

what reform means is that we would get a chance to start from scratch.
We would get to say, "if we weren't doing it this way, how would we do
it?" I believe such an review would yield a better insurance policy at a
lower cost with better health care outcomes.

Dear Jeb,

Maybe it is the word reforming that I don't understand. If I understand
you
are saying
that the budget increased but the services don't. Is that correct?
If Medicaid looks more like a private Medical Insurance that would means
deductible?
As you know I came from a Country where Medical Insurance are more
social.
The all thing is handle by the State. Everyone has a medical insurance
even
unemployed people.
Everyone has to pay and it is taking off the wages right of the bat.
NObody
is without health insurance.
Again, thank you for answering my question but I would like more details
on
how this is going
to be done..Thank you

Sincerely

Beatrice

Governor, given your busy schedule, I am reluctant to contact you, but Mike Hightower and Marty Fiorentino suggested I e-mail you directly.  We have met briefly in the past.  I am General Counsel for the City of Jacksonville and former Chief of Staff to Mayor Delaney.
 
I know of your intense interest in technology.  For nearly a year now, I have been working on a Telecommunications Master Plan for the City of Jacksonville.  After an RFP, a consultant (Black & Veatch) was selected to conduct the study.  I am Chair of a Task Force to assist the consultant.
 
This comprehensive study will (hopefully) make Jacksonville a national model on broadband deployment and seeks to create a countywide, high speed communications network that will be fundamental to economic development, education, safety, transportation, and residential uses.  The study is designed to take a comprehensive, visionary approach to creating such a network, including the deployment of fiber optics, wireless broadband, and other forms of telecommunications infrastructure. 
 
We are planning a Technology Summit in Jacksonville for March or April to: (1) educate the public and policy makers on telecommunications infrastructure and what it means to economic development, education, public safety, modernizing government,  transportation, and our future, and (2) to reveal the preliminary findings and recommendations of our consultant on the Telecommunications Master Plan.
 
I believe the summit, and this comprehensive study, is fundamentally important to the state's and city's future.  I am also very respectful of your schedule and the obvious competing demands for your time.  If at all possible, however, we would love to have you as our keynote speaker.  The Technology Summit is currently scheduled for Friday, April 4, 2003, but we have the dates of April 3, March 24, or March 28 if those are better for your schedule.  We would shift the summit to accommodate your schedule, if any of those dates are better for you.
 
I completely understand if it is not possible for you to attend.  If you can, however, I believe we are working on a bold, visionary approach to technology that is important to the future of Jacksonville and the State of Florida.  Thank you for your consideration of this request.

Governor, my name is Jon Fleischman.
I am a former Executive Director of the California Republican Party, and a
BIG FAN of yours!

Anyways, I wanted to send you a story from today's San Francisco Chronicle,
and a little editorial I penned to some friends.

I don't expect a response, I know you are crazy-busy with the budget there,
but I hope you get a chance to read this.

Take care,

A SPECIAL FLASHREPORT EDITORIAL.
The first article in today's FlashReport is a VERY IMPORTANT ONE.  In it
there is an important message for GOVERNOR JEB BUSH.  Bush and Gray Davis
placed a wager on the Superbowl... As part of the bet, Davis owes Bush some
California Wine.  In honoring the debt, Davis was going to ship Bush two
cases of 1999 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon from Groth Vineyards of Napa
Valley.  This is great wine, which retails for $150 a bottle.  A classy gift
(from such a cheap, deficit spending Governor), and a great one to receive,
right?  Well, FLORIDA makes it a FELONY to directly ship this wine to its
residents.  Even worse, it cannot even be hand carried as Florida restricts
an individual to bringing in no more than 1 gallon of wine.  As a matter of
fact, a winery owner that ships to a Florida resident can be slapped with a
FELONY.

Many of you have heard me rant about this before, but this is the first
major article I have seen in awhile that addresses this issue head-on.  For
the wine enthusiasts of Florida, I urge Governor Bush and the Florida
legislature to repeal these arcane shipping restrictions put in place by the
distributors, and allow Florida consumers to order wine to their homes, and
to bring wine home from their travels in whatever quantity they would like.
It is about freedom, and this IS America!

Please read this article below, and spread the word!

The rest of the FlashReport follows.

Bush can't pop Davis' bottle
Wine delivery snafu screws up governors' Super Bowl bet
Carol Emert, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:cemert@sfchronicle.com>

Gov. Gray Davis lost a case of California Cabernet in his Super Bowl bet
with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, but paying up is proving tougher than scoring a
touchdown for Oakland.
Florida is one of 37 states that restrict direct shipping of wine under
Prohibition-era laws. The Sunshine State is among the harshest -- any winery
owner that ships to a resident there can be extradited and slapped with a
felony.
Consequently, a dozen bottles of 1999 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (retail
price: $150 per bottle) have been gathering dust this week at Groth
Vineyards and Winery, an esteemed Napa Valley producer.
"It's caught in the logistics," said Dennis Groth, co-owner of the winery
and chairman of the Wine Institute, a trade group representing California
wineries. "I'm going to do this legally; I don't want to spend a night in
jail. "
Florida law requires all wine shipments to be routed through a licensed
network of retailers and wholesalers.
One option would be for Davis to order the wine from a Florida liquor store
and have it delivered to the governor's mansion. But the 1999 Reserve won't
be released until Saturday and isn't available in stores.
Davis can't fly to Florida and personally deliver the vino, since Florida
restricts hand-carrying across the border to 1 gallon per resident. Davis is
not a Florida resident and a case equals 2.3 gallons anyway.
Groth had planned to ask his Florida sales representative to deliver a case
to the governor's mansion in two to three weeks, after the wine makes its
regularly scheduled trip across the country. But under Florida law,
salespeople may deliver wine only for business-related sampling -- not home
imbibing.
GOING THE CHEAP ROUTE
When confronted with the legal hurdles, Davis hit upon a speedier (and
cheaper) solution: He will hand-carry two bottles of Groth Cabernet to Bush
at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C., next
month.
The two bottles -- instead of the case -- will settle the bet, said Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio.
While Florida's laws may seem Byzantine -- even bizarre -- they are hardly
unusual.
Only 13 states, including California, have signed "reciprocity" legislation
allowing shipping of wine by common carriers such as UPS and FedEx. Several
states, such as New Hampshire, require wineries to get a permit to ship
there. Others, such as Utah, don't even allow a bottle of wine to be
hand-carried in for personal consumption. Five states have made
wine-importing a felony.
"If Florida were a reciprocal state, sending this wine to the governor would
be as easy as clicking on our Web site," said Groth.
The Wine Institute has been lobbying state governments for years to relax
shipping restrictions. But wineries face an uphill battle against
wholesalers, who want to maintain their lock on liquor transportation, and
state treasury officials, who fear that direct-shipping will cost them
millions in unpaid sales taxes.
Some states also fear that minors will start ordering wine over the
Internet, using their parents' credit cards.
A federal law signed last fall by President Bush allows direct shipment of
wine to states like Florida, where hand-carrying small amounts of wine is
OK, but shipping is forbidden. The issue is legally murky, however, and none
of the major carriers will make the deliveries, fearing state governments
will continue defending their laws.
A solution may be coming through the courts. Florida is one of seven states
where legal challenges are being waged to overturn wine shipping
restrictions.
Late last year, a Florida appeals court rejected a lower-court decision
upholding Florida's shipping ban. The lower court said the ban was necessary
to collect taxes; the appeals court told them to prove it.
A New York judge has overturned a similar shipping ban, saying it
discriminates against out-of-state wineries. His decision has been stayed
pending an appeal.
Eventually, the issue is expected to land before the U.S. Supreme Court.
DAVIS CAN BLAME DAVIS
Meanwhile, Davis continues to pay for the Oakland Raiders' trouncing Sunday
by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The gubernatorial staff is busy preparing a gift basket of avocados and
pistachios to send to Tallahassee, and fixings for a San Diego fish-taco
dinner will be overnighted to Bush's personal chef.
Direct shipping of fish is apparently legal in Florida.

The Hon.Governor Bush.

I assume that you have received a numerous amount of applications  and
letters within the last several weeks with regard to the appointments to the
Southeast Volusia Hospital District which you will make this week. I have
been told by your secretary, Mrs. Knight, that you would probably make your
choices  by Thursday, January 30 Th.  

I realize that you will choose those applicants who you deem to be the best
qualified board members and those that do not mind serving in their
community.

During the past few weeks you have received several character references
from various prominent individuals within the community where I have been
faithfully serving for several years.

I have explained to you on my application exactly who I am and my
willingness to serve, and I promise you that I have no hidden agendas. I
have been blessed to pastor the largest Afro- American church in the city of
New Smyrna while living in the city of Edgewater and I would cherish the
opportunity to serve and represent all of the citizens in the city with
respect to the activities at the hospital.

I realize that after you have prayerfully chosen the ones to serve as board
members that some will be disappointed if specific names are not chosen but
I appreciate just knowing that you have taken time to just read my e-mail.

Regardless to whether I am chosen or not, I will continue to ask God to
bless and keep you and your family in the best of health.

 
GOD bless you
 
Pastor Robert Benjamin Thomas

I am writting this letter in hope that you will be able to solve my problem.  On June 5th of 2002 I applied for a qualified General Contracting license and a Mechanical license.  Since that time I have been fighting with the tremendous red tape that everyone encounters there at one time or another.  I have paid all the required fee's and supplied all of the information on numerous occasions but continue to hear additional requirements that were not stated before.  They will not give you a direct line to contact them and they do not return calls.  
 
My last conversation with them, they told me there was an error from the beginning and all of the paperwork must be filled out again.  All I requested of them is to accept a letter that I would fax immediately, that would provide all the information they were missing and end it that afternoon over the phone.  Unfortunately after an arguement, I gave up.  They would not accept anything and refused to help me again.
 
I have spent in excess of $2,500.00 and hundreds of hours of time and would like to begin practicing as a Florida contractor.  
 
Thank-you in advance for your attention to my matter.  Please feel free to call with any questions(954)410-0229.

Hi Governor:

It was so very good to see you this morning and to have an opportunity to chat.  I know you were joking...but I still want to thank you for asking if I wanted to be the Lt. Gov. I only wish I had the preparation and background to be a serious contender.  My goodness, what an honor that would be to bestow upon my family!!!  On a serious note though -- please know, if you and Columba ever need my help, I will be there.  Just contact me.

Re:  Today's BioFlorida Board Meeting -- The board completed and updated its strategic plan to help build Florida's bioscience sector, in partnership with EFI.  Items that might be of interest to you include:
1.  Related to BioFlorida's Annual Conference.  Once again, the board wants you to be the conference keynote speaker.  The conference will be held on October 19 & 20 in Orlando.  Last year, they attracted over 230 conference participants.

2.  Related to increasing the number of federal life science research facilities/centers in Florida (as recommended in EFI's biomedical tech discussion paper).  The board is attempting to identify all Florida responses to NIH RFP's, so we can garner support for these proposals.  BioFlorida will follow-up on your suggestion of using your D.C. office to support these proposals.  Three were identified today.

On a personal note, and I am going out on a limb here.  I am not sure whether you ever participate in functions that allow the average citizen an opportunity to know you as a person.  If so, I'd like to invite you to teach my adult Sunday School Class on a 3rd Sunday of your choice.

Again, it was good seeing you.  Please give my regards to Columba.  Take care!

Dear Governor Bush,
Congratulations!
Thanks for sending me the invitation for your Inaugural Event on January 6th and 7th. Since I was in India, for "Pravasi Bhartiya Divas" (Meeting of Non Resident Indians) hosted by the Prime Minister of India, I was unable to attend the Inauguration.  I 
represented   Indian-American community of Florida in that event. 
You were kind enough to reply to my earlier mails in your first year of Governorship. I, as a successful Floridian, wanted to act as a catalyst/bridge to create mutually beneficial relationship between Florida, where I  made my success and Gujarat where I was born and brought up.
Many of your good supporters and my friends,  who are Floridian, are from Gujarat. Dr. Akshay Desai, Vipin Mehta from Orlando are from Gujarat.
As a Floridian, my Company is the only Company  doing the largest  knowledge- based economic development project, "INFOCIY ( WWW.THEINFOCITY.NET)," in Gujarat. We can combine all major cities of Florida by planning similar knowledge park-HUB.
Also Florida based companies can benefit from Infrastructure Projects opportunities in Gujarat.
I will be happy to work with someone in your team for such opportunities.
Thank You for being good Governor.

Dear Governor Bush,   
 
I would like to voice my recommendation of Mr. Alan E. DeSerio as judge for the Second District Court of Appeal.  I believe you will be interviewing him on February 8th. 
 
I have had the pleasure of practicing with Mr. DeSerio for over eleven years.  Mr. DeSerio served as our former firm’s appellate lawyer and handled not only appeals originating from our firm’s trial work, but also from that of other firms.  Mr. DeSerio has extensive experience with the appellate process, as he has been counsel of record in over 150 reported appellate decisions.  As such, he would assist our former firm’s trial lawyers regarding trial strategy, whether to pursue an appeal and with basic general research on the status of the law for a given issue.  
 
            Besides the extensive experience Mr. DeSerio possesses in appellate law, Mr. DeSerio has also exhibited a deep concern for the welfare of our community, and in particular, in feeding the hungry.  He has donated enormous amounts of time to his church and our community by organizing events such as the Feast of Plenty, which is a seasonal food distribution to feed the homeless.  In 2001, Mr. DeSerio headed the event which was held one week prior to the Super Bowl in Tampa to distribute over 120,000 pounds of food to the needy.
 
            Mr. DeSerio is very well spoken, extremely intelligent, and possesses the candor and integrity worthy of being an appellate judge.  Mr. DeSerio has earned the respect of many and is the paramount professional.
 
            Because of the many outstanding personal and professional characteristics of Mr. DeSerio, I highly recommend his candidacy to you as a person immensely qualified to serve the people of Florida as an appellate judge.  If I can provide any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.  
 
Very truly yours,

Subject: trip to Spain


Dear Governor:

I just got back from Spain yesterday. I went on a business trip and I
took
advantage and in conjunction with Enterprise Florida I tried to help
with
the Spanish institutions, specially in Barcelona to make sure your trip
in
February is a complete success!.
I held meetings with :

1- Alberto Ruiz Gallardon, President Comunidad de Madrid. You met with
him
in Tallahasse when he came last year with a business delegation. He is
preparing a big reception. He told me that when he learned of your trip
he
called President Aznar ( they belong to the same party ,Partido Popular,
very similar to the Republican Party )and he told him to do "
everything"
that you ask for !!!!! AAA treatment !!
We discussed the political situation in Spain in regard to the war in
Irak.
As you know President Aznar is committed to help President Bush in spite
of
strong popular oposition to war in Spain. Since you are his
brother.......I
wanted to warn you that even though your trip is a bussines
trip......you
should expect questions from journalists about your brother and about
the
war.......in their view you will be there representing the USA and your
brother.
It breaks my heart .....the feeling of anti-americanism that you can
feel
in Spain and in Europe in general these days!
and I am very proud of President Aznar !!!!! and of President Ruiz
Gallardon !!

Please let me know if you want to discuss this issues further.....

2- Meeting with Maravillas Rojo, Barcelona City Counciwomanl and
President
of Barcelona Activa ( The Enterprise Florida of Barcelona). The
Gobernment
of The City and the Mayor, Juan Clos is Socialist ( Like the Democratic
Party here). They are very profesional.
They are very happy to have you there and they are also preparing a very
nice reception.

3- Meeting with the Chief of Staff of Jordi   Pujol, President
Generalitat
de Catalunya ( autonomous Goverment of the region of Barcelona). Super
nice
! They changed a reception with a very nice seat down dinner with
important
busines people from Barcelona. They also offered to let you use their
guest
chambersin a 13 century palace !. You have 2 hours between meetings. You
can relax in a guest room , take a shower or make telephone calls.....
They are all close friends of mine and they want to do a good job . They
want to make you feel at home!.

Let me know if I can do any other thing to make sure everything is a
success.

Best Regards.

>
> CELEBRATION -- You can bet your bottom dollar that the steep cost of a
fall production of Annie at Celebration School is stirring up controversy in
this Disney-planned community.
>
> An audit by the Osceola County School District showed that the
school-affiliated theater group that put on the musical comedy raised barely
half of $96,527 spent on the show, performed during two weekends in November
at the Gaylord Palms Resort.
>
> Some critics, including School Board member Jay Wheeler, are calling for
better financial accountability at the K-12 public school. Wheeler aired his
concerns at Tuesday night's board meeting.
>
> "I am outraged," Wheeler said, adding that he asked other School Board
members across the state if they thought the production was too extravagant.
"Nobody's ever heard of a $96,000 production for anything."
>
> Parents of the student actors appealed to the Osceola County School Board
for moral support, pledging to make good on the debt. They also asked for a
public statement explaining that Annie was funded privately and not with
district funds.
>
> Organizers are holding fund-raisers to cover a $48,399 deficit by the end
of the district's fiscal year in June.
>
> "It's an incredible operation. It's big business, and not one penny came
from the school," said Frank Harmer, a Celebration parent involved in
producing the show. "Who is to determine how parents should spend their
money?"
>
> He noted that the final production costs -- and the amount of the
deficit -- remain in dispute pending negotiations with vendors.
>
> Organizers had already spent $20,000 to $25,000 for the rights and music
to Annie, as well as some set and costume costs, when district officials
informed them about a month before opening night that the play could not be
presented in the former Tupperware Convention Center, which the district
bought last year to convert into a performing-arts school. They then lined
up space at Gaylord Palms, at a cost totaling about $60,000.
>
> By contrast, a production of Little Shop of Horrors at Gateway High School
in Kissimmee, also performed in mid-November, was produced on a shoestring.
Staging the play cost $4,700 -- $2,000 to rent a plant costume for a lead
role, $1,200 for music and licensing and $1,500 for props and the set. Costs
were covered with ticket sales, advertising and a candy fund-raiser.
>
> The Gateway High drama program used the school's theater for free, and a
staff member supervised students on light and sound equipment. Still, drama
teacher Annie Harris said she could only dream of a budget as lofty as
Celebration's Annie.
>
> "It would be lovely, but life's not fair," she said.
>
> Becausemoney raised through ticket sales and private donations was
deposited into Celebration School accounts, the school could be responsible
for the loss, district officials said. Besides Wheeler, other School Board
members did not voice any concerns about the shortfall.
>
> School Board Chairman Tom Greer chastised Wheeler for taking the issue to
Superintendent Blaine Muse, who supervises the leadership at the Celebration
School, instead of first discussing it with fellow board members.
>
> "I see this as going out on your own, and I'm not really happy about
that," Greer told Wheeler.

Subject:	WIC checks and EBT

Governor Bush:

My name is Melissa Blake.  I am seventeen years old and am employed as a
cashier at our local Publix.  A few days ago, I observed something very
disturbing, and I wanted to inform you to this matter.  A few nights ago
while I was working, two women came through my line, obviously mother and
daughter, with the daughter's toddler-aged child.  They had approximately
eight WIC checks, all valid as far as dates are concerned, which
accumulated to about three gallons of milk and two dozen eggs, among
other things.  The WIC checks amounted to close to $40.00.  Next, they
have a moderately sized order.  This order includes: Disney cereal, which
costs about $3.25 a box, sweets and candy, there may have been some soda
in there, and the list goes on.  What disturbs me about this is that this
last order was about $70.00.  And they paid for it with EBT.  There were
no fresh fruits or vegetables in this order.  I believed, before I saw
this, that EBT was supposed to pay for balanced, healthy meals for people
who otherwise cannot afford them.  Everything on that conveyor belt was
approved for food stamps.  I know that because when someone pays with
government aid, we have a food stamp button we must push to separate the
order in the computer and remove the taxes.  I personally believe that
EBT should not pay for these people to "live the high life" of sorts with
food.  I also believe there need to be tougher restrictions on what is
covered by WIC.  Kraft singles cheese, 16oz, is covered by WIC.  This
package of cheese is approximately $2.25, if memory serves me correctly. 
These people by no means should not have the absolute bare minimum, yet
they should also not be milking the government in order to live a nicer
life.  I appreciate your time in reading this, it is a very important
issue to me.  I see our government being taken advantage for a lot in my
job, and it bothers me to see it happen.  Again, thank you so much.  I
will look forward to hearing from you.

Subject:	Successful Intelligence Does Not An FCAT Make!!!
Attachments:	Card for Jean Pierre Medani <inadem@comcast.net>

Dear Governor Bush;

It is hard for me to believe that I am sitting in front of my computer 
writing this email to you.  Not just because of the issues I am 
concerned about, but because I honestly cannot believe that my children 
will suffer because of legislation that is so insensitive to their God 
given civil rights.

How dare the educational system say that our children have low IQ's 
because they cannot take the FCAT's like others and successfully pass!  
I have two autistic children who are exceptionally bright and very high 
functioning.  I doubt that either of them would be able to take these 
exams the "traditional" way, but I can tell you that with the 
appropriate considerations made for their disability, they could pass 
them.  

I am curious to know if you know of a woman named Temple Grandin?  She 
has autism.  When she was first diagnosed, doctors told her parents 
that she was also mentally retarded because she could not speak and 
only groaned or made incomprehensible sounds for words.  She threw 
severe tantrums, scratched and clawed at herself and others and also 
played in her own feces.  Her parents refused to listen to the 
physicians and sought "special" teachers and other educators to help 
her.  You see; she learned differently than others.  She thought 
in "pictures".  Many years have passed since that time and she is now a 
very successful Associate Professor of Animal Sciences at the 
University of Colorado.  She is known nationally and internationally 
for her books (Thinking in Pictures and Emergence/Labeled Autistic) and 
is sought after for her designs and opinions on raising livestock 
humanely.  

Governor Bush; if you are not familiar with Ms. Grandin, please take 
the time to read her books.  Never in your life will you be able to 
step into the mind of an autistic child and see and feel what they do.  
I learned more about my own two children through this woman than she 
will ever know.  Someday, I hope to shake her hand and thank her.  

I think Ms. Grandin and Robert Steinberg have alot in common.  Mr. 
Steinberg wrote a book called "Successful Intelligence".  He is also 
living proof that traditional methods of testing IQ's and knowledge do 
not work for every child.  Exceptions were made for these people as 
children and they have gone on to prove that the educational systems we 
entrust our children to are not always right.

It has been said that "We do not own the earth; We simply borrow it 
from our children."  How do we give it back to them Mr. Bush, if we are 
not willing to invest in their futures?

I can only hope and pray that you will continue to fight for the rights 
of disabled children in our educational system.  They deserve better 
than what they are being offered and it disgusts me to see sorrow in 
the eyes of such beautiful children at the hands of beaurocracy!

My family will pray for your strength and persistence in safeguarding 
the education of our children.  I hope that you are able to make the 
changes that are necessary as I would hate to regret my relocation to 
the "Sunshine State".

God Bless You and Yours,

Marsha A. Medani (Mother of Michaella and Nicolas)

Dear Governor Bush:

Just a quick note. Recently I attended the Martin Luther King Breakfast at Indian River Community College and heard President Ed Massey speak.  I have to tell you he did a wonderful job!  Mr. Massey spoke highly about One Florida and your new reading program and incorporated most of the Republican goals and accomplishments to the breakfast crowd of predominantly Democrats.  It took great courage for him to stand his ground as a Republican and speak out and tell everyone there how great these programs are going to be for our community and for the whole state.   

I just thought I'd pass along something good instead of something negative that's happening in our community here.  This message kept slipping my mind since the event and this morning I felt a strong need for it to be passed on to you.

Hope you are having a blessed day.  My blessings and prayers always to you and your family and to Frank and his new family.

Most respectfully yours,

Subject:	Recurring funding for the Florida Center for Reading Research

Dear Governor Bush,

I want to thank you again for responding so quickly to the e-mail I sent 
expressing concern about recurring funding of $1.6 million for the Florida 
Center for Reading Research at Florida State University. I want to 
highlight again how critical this type of funding will be to our success 
over both the short and long term in accomplishing your vision for the 
center. In a follow-up meeting I had with President Wetherell, he expressed 
solid support for new recurring general revenue to operate the FCRR. As a 
result, FSU has made funding for the Center a very high priority item with 
the Legislature this year, but Dr. Wetherell indicated they  will also need 
active support from you and Secretary Horne to get it accomplished.

Again, I express my appreciation to you not only for your interest in 
establishing a leading Center for research in reading in Florida, but also 
for what you have done, and are doing, to promote literacy in Florida.

Best,

Joe Torgesen

Subject: FTAA


Jeb: I note that you will be down key-noting and dining this Friday
night. I look forward to seeing you.

    I was wondering whether it might be possible for Ambassador Rocha,
Shanker Singham, and I to sit down with you at your convenience,
either
here in Miami or in Tallahassee as you prefer, to discuss some issues
dealing with the FTAA and its location here in Miami. We had a  great
lunch with Secretary Evans and discussed some of these issues. There
are
some real timing issues, and your involvement would be key.

    We have been involved with the FTAA stuff from the bitter
beginning. It is moving along well now, and we want to keep it that
way.
I mentioned to Chuck that I would be contacting you while we were both
at the Evans lunch. (Incidentally, he was an excellent choice as Chair
of the Organizing Group, and we are very excited about the rumors
circulating that Armando may well be President of the ABF.)

   In any event, Shanker and Ambassador Rocha have been extensively
involved in these issues for some time. Shanker is on the Council For
Foreign Relations and has served as an advisor to Lawton, Buddy McKay,
and Katherine over the years. He  is a wealth of information and will
be
speaking at the same event as will you on Friday — he was able to
answer a number of Don Evans's questions at the meeting. Incidentally,
Don was very flattering — I was amazed that he even remembered me.)

    Please let me know if and when. Joe

Dear Governor Bush:

Thank you for taking the time to read my e-mail.

I can see why you would feel that the DOE should take on the responsibilities of monitoring the school district. However, when a crisis occurs such as the ones I mentioned in my message, parents need to be able to seek out local support.  The only way I can explain it is to offer an example.

My husband works for State Farm Insurance.  If an insured gets in an accident, he contacts his local agent.  The insured would feel lost if they had to contact the corporate office in Bloomington, ILL.   That is how parents look at the DOE.  They are not a household name, family friendly institution.  We think of the DOE as the president's office and not the first place to seek out help.

If the DOE is the place for parents to be contacting, maybe we need to somehow "market" their name within the community.  

Thank you for offering your perspective and I will certainly discuss it with other parents.

As a side note, I know that we have the ability to do what is right and there are a few schools that I have worked with who are outstanding and would make great role models.  I continue to sing their praise every chance I get.

Also, I would like to commend you for creating the FCAT Blue Ribbon Task Force.  I just heard the recommendations made by the committee and I am very excited to see the changes.

I recognize that you are extremely busy so I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts.

Have a wonderful weekend.

Sincerely,

Subject:	Sallie Mae

Governor:  I understand from Sally that you were concerned with the meetings we scheduled yesterday with our client Sallie Mae and both Sec. Horne and his staff and Kathleen Shanahan.  For the record, these were intended to be two seperate meetings.  Our first meeting with Sec. Horne, Larry Wood, Wayne Pierson and Dan Woodring was to discuss the details of the privitization request and get some feedback from them on issues that need to be addressed as we move forward.  The second meeting was specifically for your Chief of Staff to address the role of the Governor in the process - the federal law clearly assigns the role of state guarantor to that of the Governor, not the chief state school officer.  As you recall, we addressed this issue in Miami.  It was never our intention, nor was it at our invitation, to have Sec. Horne and his staff, who are equally busy,  attend this second meeting.  It was as much to our surprise to see a room full of the same people at the second meeting.  We appreciate the time of your staff and would never schedule a meeting just for the sake of meeting.  Also for the record, Sallie Mae is a client we have represented for nearly two years.  They compensate us based upon a monthly retainer, just like all of our clients.  There are no benefits to us for additional meetings.  
 
I just wanted to clear up any confusion and close the loop on this.  Let me know if you need to discuss further.

Subject: DCF - what if?

 

Usually I'm sending you ideas, but I would appreciate some th oughtful input from you for a program I'm developing that might help you more effectively, efficiently and safely oversee DCF operations.

 

If you and DCF executives could have 6 pieces of information ON EACH CHILD IN DCF CUSTODY to easily review each day, INFORMATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE "ANSWERS" TO 6 MAJOR CONCERNS, what would those 6 be?   For example   what if you could easily see in a matter of seconds how many children hadn't been visited in more than 30 days.  Or how about if you could see in seconds if a school age child in foster care had missed more than a certain number of days of school, or in a few seconds see how many children appeared to be "too thin" or "too fat"?

 

If you could pick 6 things you would like to know about a child in DCF care, what would they be?

 

I believe if you will take a little time to discuss this with your staff and provide me with the feedback, I might be able to offer you a revolutionary idea that will appeal to your love of technology, save you and staff time, and provide the means to better serve the taxpayers of Florida while providing better service to DCF participants.

Good morning Governor.

Hope all is well with your family.

My guess is you have already decided on the individual
you plan to nominate as Lt. Governor.  If by chance
you have not, I would like to recommend and remind you
of our mutual friend, Al Cardenas.  He is universally
well liked by all of your supporters that wear white
hats.

As Al has talked with both of us, he wants more time
with his family.  However, he is a dedicated, sincere
patriot that would heed your call to public service as
an interim officer, just as Jim Smith did.

Thanks for reading my suggestion.

Jeb,
 
We had a very productive meeting with Cornelia Orr and Shan Goff yesterday regarding the AT/ FCAT pilot project(John Winn was not able to attend). Cornelia and Shan definately share your "sense of urgency" on getting things moving AND quickly and they certainly know "their business".
 
Here's the deal...we laid out a plan of attack which will be written up in detail and formally  presented to Jim/John in the next two weeks.
 
Highlights:
 
1) Advisory board consiting of 10 experienced "roll up the sleeves" workers who can make this happen quickly
2) Board meeting asap to confirm and initiate strategy and move....move....move.
3) "Hit the ground running" demonstration of web enabled FCAT...Spring '03(shooting for March)
4)  Comparability/AT study ...50,000 students ...Fall'03
5)  Launch grades 7 and 10...Spring '04
6)  Launch other grades as quickly as feasible.
 
Jeb, we will continue to need your involvement and support in order for this to be successful.Vantage is committed, the technology is there, the students are ready and we have the right team in place to make this successful. What we have to do...is continue to rally the "troops" and get them behind this effort to put Florida in the forefront.
 
We are stoked...

FYI: More to help the funding issue. Some of us finally made enough noise to get people to start waking up to the funding drain of the so stated sports teams. All across the country cities/communities are being drained, using the "private business hype" of the so stated pro sports teams - why is tax funding allowed? Consider the riots, drugs - and the negative impact these teams bring to a city/community/state - why are tax funds paying for the private business mess?!
 
Please read the article below regarding a mess/huge debt the taxpayers in Nashville, TN and many other cities across the country are forced to pay. Then consider only about 3-4 % of the state population use the "private business facilities" - so why do all 96+% of the taxpayers have to pay - for what they: do not use?!
 
Will the new governor clean up "his past mess?" Or will it be spend and tax as usual?
 
Have a nice day!

It's hard to reconcile, but the largest building projects in Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Houston and Cincinnati have not been in neighborhoods or new public schools.

The largest municipal activity across the nation has been in constructing stadia and arenas for pro sports teams. As the $250 million FedExForum for the NBA Grizzlies rises there, Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton this week asked for a referendum to turn control of city schools over to Shelby County because of costs.

Yet all this pro sports construction has come with the clear approval of voters or their representatives. That includes Nashville. Measuring the returning value from this monumental municipal investment, however, is far from obvious. Economists and chambers of commerce differ sharply.

That's frightening fiscally, since Metro faces looming new costs for pro sports. The Coliseum needs more than $24 million in maintenance the next 17 years. A ticket tax would only cover $17 million of that bill. A resolution passed this week by the Council asks the Sports Authority and Mayor Bill Purcell to explore enclosing and adding seating to The Coliseum to attract events like the Super Bowl.

In two cities today, there is little disagreement about the value. Oakland and Tampa Bay have teams in the Super Bowl, the mother of all media events. The Super Bowl is the ultimate prize in our capitalist society. Having a chance to play in the Super Bowl is worth a lot to a lot of cities and people.

Just how much is enough and too much to invest for a city remains unanswered. There are some certainties: The cost to maintain pro sports always keeps rising. And no one has yet to put an accurate number on the returning value.

That's ironic for sports businesses that rely on instant replay to correct errors and run games to the second.

Measuring the Titans

The Titans cost Metro taxpayers $11 million a year from the budget. That includes bond payments for notes sold to build the Coliseum. It also accounts for a $1 million annual maintenance fee.

That sum is not going to break any major city's budget. It is enough, however, to keep a mayor from fully pursuing new initiatives like the need for safe, decent affordable housing here. Purcell's administration applies the following standard when sports collide other community interests:

''We've got certain obligations we know, the stadium is one,'' said Bill Phillips, Metro deputy mayor. ''That's part of the base in planning the budget, like the basic cost of police work. The priorities are safety and health and education, not necessarily in that order. So if it's a difference in spending a little extra on something like sports and education, then education is going to get first.''

The Predators take more than $5 million a year from the budget. That cost is rising because the arena is operating at a deficit.

The pro sports bill in Nashville is climbing closer to $20 million a year. That's the equivalent of four new police precincts. Yet few people are complaining. Ludye Wallace, former president of the local NAACP and now Metro councilman, was sponsor of the resolution for new Coliseum spending.

It's easy to push that idea now. Most of the Midstate is still basking in the Titans season. The team went from a 1-4 start to the AFC championship game. Fans and retailers celebrated. Merchandise sales meant more sales tax, the lifeblood of state government.

A tremendous amount of good will is generated in a city from such a season. It appeals across race and class, bringing people together to root for the same thing. That's worth a lot. Teams also set up charities. Players become ambassadors and role models.

''It is very difficult to say it brings in X amount of dollars,'' Phillips said. ''As for the benefits, one of the indicators is downtown. You can see activity. It is generating activity that wasn't there the night before. A Monday Night Football game is something you can't buy, and if it is a beautiful night and the skyline is shown, that is a benefit, and you don't know how many people say 'I want to go there for the weekend.'

''Ticket holders (60%) for the Titans games are from other counties, and they wouldn't be here on Sunday. I don't think anyone argues there is a plus factor.''

The credibility of claims of value suffer, however, when NFL owners get involved. Titans' owner Bud Adams projected that his team pumped $109 million a year in direct spending into the economy. Economists dispute such estimates, including claims that the Super Bowl means a $500 million boost to the host city. Robert Baade at Lake Forest College in Illinois says the real impact is $50 million.

Separating myth from fact

Pro sports recirculate existing spending income in a city or area, not create new wealth, say economists. It means taking sales from one business to give to another.

The Commercial-Appeal, in surveying economists about FedExForum, reached this consensus: ''Much of the money generated by sales in and around an arena comes mostly at the expense of businesses elsewhere in the area.''

Nationwide, 10% to 20% of football fans come to games outside a home team's metro area, bringing a party of four, The Houston Chronicle reported in quoting Patrick Rishe, an economist at Webster University in St. Louis. That means tourism spending in an NFL city is overestimated. It also explains why several prominent restaurants have closed in downtown Nashville despite pro sports.

The Chronicle also surveyed economists on the impact of the new Reliant Stadium. Beyond the recirculation of spending, they said ''another mistake these [NFL] studies sometimes make is assuming out-of-towners attending a game have visited a community solely for that reason rather than taking in a game while already being in Houston on business. ... A sports franchise may actually depress an economy because the dollars generally go to a team owner and players who may live elsewhere during the off-season and that spending at places such as restaurants return more money to a local economy.''

Reliant Stadium's impact probably is about $100 million a year, The Chronicle concluded. But it's also a domed stadium. It gets events year-round. The Chronicle's conclusion makes Adams' projections of $109 million here wildly optimistic.

No one can dispute that NFL teams bring in big TV money to a home city. TV and the teams provide exposure and great entertainment. Most major U.S. cities are deeply involved in making their municipalities more competitive for the growing entertainment dollar.

In his book Fantasy City, author John Hannigan writes that a long-term benefit to cities in the pursuit of pro sports teams is the private-public partnerships established. They become a force in redeveloping dilapidated areas of downtown and bringing back the dollars of the middle and upper classes.

The flip side is that entertainment centers hurt the poor people already living there. To bring the middle and upper classes back to spend, these places must be made to look safe. That means keeping dangerous-looking folks out, Hannigan wrote.

Image or illusion is everything in pro sports. TV money pays salaries for NFL players. The 2002 salary cap per team was more than $70 million, The Chronicle said. That's a nice business payroll for a city. But not every Titan or Predator lives in Nashville. Some live in Williamson County. The Chronicle said studies show half or fewer of players live in the home city.

Thankfully, Tennessee is not like Ohio, yet. Governments there have spent $2 billion-plus on stadia and arenas the past 10 years. The Columbus Dispatch asked economists to measure the economic impact.

''If you want economic development, you bring in a manufacturer or improve the schools. ... The only times you see it [pro sports] making economic sense is from people who are paid to say that,'' said Kevin Grace at the University of Cincinnati.

Writes Hannigan: ''Despite their symbolic value, however, professional sports teams and facilities rarely constitute a good financial deal for the city. Contrary to the hype, professional sports franchises are essentially small-scale businesses which account for no more than half of 1% of jobs or salaries in any urban county with 300,000 or more residents. This compares against leisure facilities such as restaurants and bars, which provide nearly 7% of jobs … .''

Pro sports teams certainly can be considered a plus for a city. But they must no longer be portrayed as an economic factor and thus an investment. They are an amenity, an extra that boosts good will and exposure and thus an expenditure. So come budget time, this new, accurate awareness should put pro sports in its proper place — to wait for its money and no longer move to the head of the long line. ?

Governor Bush:
Thank you for your continued support of diversifying the economy of Florida, this is a top priority for us in Pasco County. I look forward to working with you and your staff during the very difficult upcoming legislative session. 
 
It was a pleasure to briefly speak with you last Tuesday at the Enterprise Florida Reception about my 25 year old nephew that was recently involved in stopping a prisoner accused of killing a Tallahassee police officer from escaping from the Leon County jail. His name is Bryan J. Cornwell and he is a Corrections Officer with the Leon County Sheriff's  Dept. I've attached the news story. 
 
What the newspaper didn't say was that Bryan was in fact able to get into the cell and single handedly handcuffed the prisoner before any back-up arrived. A getaway car was waiting outside. We are all extremely proud of Bryan in that a corrections officer with only 5 years of experience had the presence of mind to know how to handle this difficult situation. Of course, we are all very thankful that he was not seriously injured or killed in the process. I understand that he has been nominated for an outstanding law enforcement award. I know it would mean the world to him if you could acknowledge his efforts by sending him a letter; it would be wonderful for him to know that his bravery was recognized by more than just his family. His address is:
 
Bryan J. Cornwell

I sincerely appreciate your assistance with matter. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Dear Mr. Krongold

As per the suggestion of Jimmy Resnick, I send you this e-mail to provide 
you some background about Agudath Israel. As you are a member of the Jewish 
Community who has used his friendships and contacts for the furthering of 
many Jewish causes, it is indeed a priviledge and an honor to correspond 
with you on behalf of Agudath Israel.

As Jimmy by now mentioned to you we are trying to arrange for a delegation 
to go to Tallahassee to meet with Governor Bush and other government 
officials to discuss various matters of importance to the Jewish Community. 
It would seem logical to me that if you would be so kind as to help arrange 
a meeting some time in late March with Governor Bush; we would then work 
other meetings around that. I greatly appreciate your assistance and I look 
forward to perhaps meeting you soon.

Agudath Israel of America, founded in 1922, is a broad-based Orthodox Jewish

coalition movement functioning under the guidance of the Council of Torah 
Sages, a distinguished rabbinic policy-making body whose members are senior 
Torah scholars of international renown. In August 1999, Agudath Israel of 
South Florida was founded in order to expand and focus efforts specifically 
in the Jewish Community of South Florida.

Agudath Israel of America advocates for the rights of Orthodox Jews in the 
nation's workplaces and neighborhoods, and for the protection and needs of 
Jewish religious institutions. It also provides information about the 
American Orthodox community to the media and general public, and takes 
public positions on important issues of moral and social concern.

Jewish education, the backbone of Jewish continuity, of Agudath Israel of 
America's prime concerns, and the organization sponsors a host of projects 
and endeavors to help
bring the texts and teachings of Jewish tradition to Jews across the 
country, as well as to help foster and enhance the observance of Judaism 
nationwide.

Agudath Israel of America is active as well in promoting Jewish life and 
welfare in the nations of the former Soviet Union, in Israel and in other 
lands, hosting a number of
humanitarian and religious projects around the globe. Agudath Israel also 
assists Jews in other lands in need of physical protection or immigration 
assistance.

Among Agudath Israel of America's numerous endeavors on the "home front" of 
the American Jewish community are: an employment service, vocational 
training and counseling services, housing and neighborhood preservation 
initiatives (including mortgage counseling and homeowner/tenant counseling 
services), assistance to food-for-the-hungry agencies, and a host of 
senior-citizen and children's welfare projects.

Agudath Israel of America's Orthodox Jewish Archives is a repository of 
documents and photographs of Jewish life over the past several decades that 
serves students and scholars alike in their explorations of recent Jewish 
history.

The Jewish Observer, an English-language journal of thought and opinion, Dos

Yiddishe Vort, its Yiddish-language counterpart, and Coalition, a periodical

of news and Current events, are Agudath Israel of America's official 
publications, and serve to inform and educate their readerships about the 
Orthodox Jewish world. Other Agudath Israel publications provide information

to the Jewish public regarding Torah-classes and religious services in the 
New York City area, and Agudath Israel provides information about Jewish 
resources nationwide and globally as well.

Sincerely yours,

Hello, Governor
I hope you have a nice weekend, well in a few short days we both will be one
year older, mines the 10th and your the 11th. And lot more smarter, but more
than anything blessed. I don't want to sound like a snitch, but there is some
problem over here in DEP with Benji and your upper staff. Well the 10 floor
and some of the people here in my office.  said he is making promise to
people that DEP can't do. and doing things that not DEP related. I spoke with
the secretary a few weeks ago, he wanted to know from me what was going on. I
didn't like being put on the spot, but I told him the truth. But I just
wanted to say to you I will do and stand up for you  to who ever needed from
somebody making you look bad if needed around the state. I know you might not
understand this email, but please keep this between me and you I will share
with you when time permits.

Subject:	FIU Centro Madrid

Governor Jeb Bush
Tallahassee, Florida

FACTS
On January 21, 2003 an agreement ("Protocolo") was signed in Madrid between
Miami-Dade County and La Comunidad de Madrid, the regional government of
Madrid, whereby the two governments have partnered to cooperate in higher
education, and back-up their commitments by jointly funding the operations
of the FIU Madrid-Miami Center for Education, Research and Development, with
matching funds and support from the Fundación Universitaria San Pablo-CEU of
Madrid, Spain, and FIU.

OPPORTUNITY
At a time when the State of Florida has been forced to cut back its funding
to state universities, I believe you can emphasize, during your trip to
Madrid and by visiting the FIU Center (one block from the US Embassy in
Madrid), that through your leadership, new and innovative private/public and
local/international partnerships are being created in the higher education
arena. These initiatives can serve as a model for other similar endeavors
assuring the funding needed to further expand the existing excellent
relationships between Spain and Florida (gateways to Europe and the
Americas).
Also, with private partners such as Telefonica, the FIU Madrid Center will
become a focal point of virtual community for scientists from all over the
world. Thus, the State of Florida and its universities are, and will
continue, to fulfill the responsibility of enhancing the quality of life of
its citizens by supporting higher education and thus enhancing international
trade and commerce.

I am attaching--via fax--an additional fact sheet for your staff, as well as
published articles in relation to the signing of the "Protocolo" in Madrid.
I will gladly work with your staff to coordinate your visit to the FIU
Madrid Center.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely yours,

Rafael Diaz-Balart

Subject:	Bond Sale and Proposal for Additional Refundings

Governor Bush:

	We sold $277 million of PECO bonds yesterday at 4.31%. The
transaction was part refunding, part new money.  The refunding piece
generated present-value savings of $13.9 million.  I was pleased with the
sale and the level of savings generated.

	In thinking about ways we can save the State money, it occurred to
me that it may be an opportune time, with the President's tax proposal on
the table, to pursue changes to the tax code beneficial to State and local
governments.  Current federal tax law limits State and local governments'
ability to lower its borrowing cost through refinancings by allowing only
one advance refunding during the life of a bond issue.  The policy
underlying this rule is to limit the federal subsidy (the feds consider
tax-exempt debt as a federal subsidy because the interest is not subject to
federal income taxes) for tax-exempt bonds.  The practical effect on the
State is to prevent us from lowering our debt service costs through
refinancing for bonds that have been advance refunded previously.

	The State has approximately $4.8 billion of debt that cannot be
advance refunded a second time.  Of this amount, approximately $2.8 billion
could be advance refunded at lower rates based on current interest rate
levels.  I estimate potential gross debt service savings of approximately
$161 million (or $121 million on a present value basis) if the State were
allowed an additional advance refunding of its debt.  In our case, most of
the savings is on PECO bonds so the savings could help us pay for class size
reduction.  To the extent the savings are used for additional school
construction, it could also provide stimulus for the economy.  

	I am bringing this to your attention because it seems timely in
light of the President's tax plan and reasonably consistent with some of the
policy objectives underlying the proposal.  It also has the added virtue of
potentially saving the State money during these difficult economic times by
allowing us to take advantage of lower interest rates.  Additionally, there
is some precedent to this idea in that Congress allowed New York City
issuers an additional advance refunding in connection with the relief
provided for rebuilding lower Manhattan from the destruction caused by the
9/11 terrorist attacks.

	By way of background, an additional advance refunding seems to be a
perennial request from State and local government groups, other issuers of
tax-exempt bonds and industry trade groups so it is not really a novelty on
Capitol Hill.  I would not be surprised to see it surface again in
connection with the tax bill.  Also, Treasury is never keen on expanding
authority for tax-exempt bonds.  I just wanted you to be aware of this and
consider whether it has sufficient merit to pursue in some way.

	As always, I am available at your convenience to discuss this issue
or answer any questions you may have.  Please let me know if you have any
interest in pursuing this.

I am emailing you because a local educator emailed you a while back about getting some compensation for moving here from out of state (Canada) to Florida and she was promised a pay compensation (SHE TOOK A 50% PAY DECREASE WHEN SHE MOVED HERE) she has been guidance consular/Teacher for 27 YEARS and she is making less then 39,000 dollars a year. THIS BOTHERS ME NOT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T GET THE MONEY SHE WAS PROMISED BUT THAT I TOLD HER THAT SHE COULD TRUST YOU AND YOUR ADMINISTRATION!  You helped me with school a while back and I bragged about you but can you please help her?? She sent an email to you and you said that you would forward the email well that was the last and first reply she got 5 months ago for anyone!

Subject:	DCF idea

Governor,
 
I want to run an idea by you.  I am working on some projects with Kay Stephenson's group SmartCops.  They partner on many projects with Steve Goldsmith at ACS and with Nextel.  My concept is to take the ChildTrack program that Steve told you about and combine it with the Nextel phone and snap on camera.
 
Basically it would work like this.
Case worker arrives at childs location.  Dials office number on Nextel Phone.  Child Track application runs on Nextel phone, caseworker enters childs ID and answers 3-5 questions on basic condition.  Then caseworker uses Nextel camera to take childs picture.  All Nextel phones have a GIS chip and time stamp.  So central database is immediately updated with Child's picture, location and timestamp.  This would eliminate ability to falsify visit reports.  It also would satisfy blue-ribbon panel recommendation for pictures as well as provide photographic evidence of childs condition every time they are visited.  There are a lot of other features and benefits, but that was the high point.
 
Every caseworker already has a cell phone so that cost will be minimal.  Steve says that with a better tracking system the state should be able to pull down a significant amount of Title IV-E dollars which (according to Steve) may completely offset costs.
 
Nextel and ACS are high on the potential for the project.  I am going to try and get with Jerry Regier soon to discuss, but wanted to see if you had any feedback first.
 
Thanks

Dear Boyden,

My meeting with Governor Bush went extremely well.  He sees Sunol's RFP as an excellent opportunity for Florida, bringing credibility and visibility to the State as a real player in biotechnology.  He had the same question as you, that is, asking how he could help.  Realizing we did not have an answer, he asked Brett Doster, his Deputy Director for the Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development, to set up a teleconference with his staff in the State D.C. office and us.  I expect these discussions to take place in the next few days.  He also asked that I keep him informed on the progress we make with his staff.  I suggested he give you a call and expect that he will.

Attached is the Fact Sheet I prepared for the Governor.  This summary may be of help to you as well.

Please let us know if you need anything additional information.  I will also keep you advised of anything that develops on the State side.

"Mayor Glenda Hood reveals a city budget deficit she kept under wraps until after she got the secretary of state job from Jeb Bush. Hood is the one who gave the Navy base away for less than a song."  Mike Thomas, Orlando Sentinel

==============================
In Baldwin Park gold rush, mayor sold land cheap




Mike Thomas

January 30, 2003

Now I know why unemployment is down in Central Florida.

Half the population is out at Baldwin Park swinging hammers.

You'd think this was Noah's crew, working on the ark with the storm clouds approaching. The term "throwing up houses" does not do justice to what is going on out there. I hope they're taking time to put mortar between all those bricks.

This is a California gold rush, Florida style.

It seems the only one not getting rich from it is the city that first owned the mine -- Orlando.

The city had a one-shot opportunity to profit from the hottest piece of real estate in Florida -- the old Naval Training Center -- and flubbed it.

Think of that as Mayor Glenda Hood reveals a city budget deficit she kept under wraps until after she got the secretary of state job from Jeb Bush. Hood is the one who gave the Navy base away for less than a song.

How hot is this place? In 1998, Orlando Partners, the development group that initially won the right to the site, said home prices would range from the low $100,000s to $275,000. In other words, there would be room for the middle class.

That price was jacked up in 2001 to $150,000 for a condominium, but even that number was fantasy. Homes begin at about $275,000, if you can find one at that price. More than likely, you'll be looking at $300,000-plus for an entry-level home.

You can barely get in a condominium for less than $220,000.

Even those prices don't reflect the true cost of housing.

The Pritzker family, which is developing the site, took full advantage of one of Florida's biggest real-estate scams -- the Community Development District. It raised almost $76 million through bond sales to pay for the infrastructure and parks.

Those who move into Baldwin Park now must pay off many of these bonds.

Even if you buy the least expensive house, you will have to pay $750 a year to the Community Development District for the next 30 years. You will have to pay almost $2,000 if you buy one of the more expensive homes.

You will have to pay another $400 a year to maintain infrastructure such as lighting, a cost that can vary from year to year.

You will have to pay another $550 a year to the property owners association for the upkeep of common areas, another variable cost.

If you buy a town house, there is a $215 monthly service fee.

None of this includes city taxes.

But even at these prices, even in these uncertain economic times, inventory is moving fast.

The salespeople don't beg. They don't follow you out the door. They readily pass you on to the competitors. They know if you don't buy from them, someone else will walk through the door soon enough. Life on commission never was easier.

It didn't take a genius to see the potential. All you had to do was look at prices at Celebration in Osceola County and translate them to a location sandwiched between Winter Park and Orlando.

And Glenda Hood dumped it for $6,900 an acre, plus a bundle of incentives that added millions more to the Pritzker fortune.

We didn't even get a regional park out of the deal.

I wanted to take the opportunity to advise that a temporary solution has
been worked out between Aetna Insurance and Bert Fish Hospital regarding
continuation of insurance priviledges at the hospital for our city
employees
and thousands of others.  We are still working to find a long term
solution
by trying to insure that a contract is reached.  We have not brokered a
solution to the difficulties between the Blues and the hospitals, but
they
continue to talk.  As City Manager, I continue to work with the
hospitals
and they continue to work with me.  Thank you again.

I have been asked to provide the name of Mr. Jim Russell as an
individual
who you might wish to consider for appointment to the Hospital Board.
He is
a Volusia County resident.  His phone number is (386) 423-5792 and/or
(386)
423-2001.  He resides at 880 Flounder Avenue, New Smyrna Beach, Florida
32169.  I can secure additional information should you require.  Frank
Roberts, City Manager, New Smyrna Beach

Dear Governor Bush:

This correspondence is being sent to you in support of Alan Deserio, who is 
a candidate for an Appellate Judge for the Florida Second District Court of 
Appeals. Although Alan did not ask me to send a letter of support, I felt 
compelled to do so. I am a businessman, and I have known Alan for many 
years on a professional level. He is one of the most respected Appellate 
Attorneys in the State of Florida. He is known for his high moral and 
ethical standards. I could not think of a better candidate to fill the 
position of Appellate Judge for the Second District Court of Appeals, and I 
highly recommend that you consider Alan for this position.

If you have any questions, you may contact me at the following location:

Richard Harris & Associates, Inc.

Respectfully Submitted,

Governor, I am pleased to report that Tim Vacarro, Executive Director of the Construction Industry Licensing Board, and his staff have successfully resolved Mr. Morrissette's licensing problems as described below in the e-mail from Tim Vacarro to me.  Diane Carr  

 

Secretary Carr:

My office has been working in conjunction with the Central intake Unit (CIU) to resolve Mr. Morrissette's licensing issue. 

Mr. Morrissette holds a Mechanical Contractors license which qualified Latent Mechanical Inc. CIU received Mr. Morrissette's application to obtain a Certified General Contractors license on October 18, 2002. His application was validated on October 28, 2002 and was issued a deficiency letter on October 31, 2002. In the deficiency letter CIU requested:

1. A master individual application to be completed and be submitted.

2. A master organization application for qualified business to be completed and be submitted. (Mr. Morrissette wished to qualify Latent Contracting Inc. through the GC license.)

3. He needed to answer a question in regards to any organizational relationships on page 21 of the application. This question asks if an applicant qualifies any company other than the one he is presently trying to qualify.

4. He needed to resubmit a bank verification letter. The one that he submitted did not meet the minimum cash requirement of $10,000.00.

CIU did not receive the information from Mr. Morrissette. Subsequently, CIU determined that Mr. Morrissette held his mechanical license for less than one year. Pursuant to board rule he was not able to qualify a second business. He could, however, operate with both licenses under the name "Latent Contracting Inc." On January 29, 2003, Jessica McGregor in CIU telephoned Mr. Morrissette and attempted to explain and walk him through the process of filling out the appropriate application. Apparently, there was some confusion, and Ms. McGregor was unable to reach a resolution. 

Ms. McGregor explained the paperwork to me, and I subsequently telephoned Mr. Morrissette to reassure him that we could resolve the matter. He was very pleased. We faxed him the necessary applications, which he subsequently returned completed. My analyst, Stacey Merchant, and Ms. McGregor handled the necessary processing immediately, and I arranged to waive any additional licensing fees. I left a detailed message with Mr. Morrissette's office and, to the best of my knowledge, this matter is now resolved.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Tim Vaccaro

Executive Director

Construction Industry Licensing Board

I am writting this letter in hope that you will be able to solve my problem.  On June 5th of 2002 I applied for a qualified General Contracting license and a Mechanical license.  Since that time I have been fighting with the tremendous red tape that everyone encounters there at one time or another.  I have paid all the required fee's and supplied all of the information on numerous occasions but continue to hear additional requirements that were not stated before.  They will not give you a direct line to contact them and they do not return calls.  
 
My last conversation with them, they told me there was an error from the beginning and all of the paperwork must be filled out again.  All I requested of them is to accept a letter that I would fax immediately, that would provide all the information they were missing and end it that afternoon over the phone.  Unfortunately after an arguement, I gave up.  They would not accept anything and refused to help me again.
 
I have spent in excess of $2,500.00 and hundreds of hours of time and would like to begin practicing as a Florida contractor.  
 
Thank-you in advance for your attention to my matter.  Please feel free to call with any questions(954)410-0229.
 
Sincerely,
 
James Morrissette

Governor-
Just dropping you a note to thank you for the opportunity to serve in your 
administration.  The last year and a half of service with Kim Bahrami at the 
STO was tremendous and I learned more than I could have ever expected.  I 
wish you all the best in the next four years and look forward to the 
opportunity to work hand in hand with you as we reshape Florida for the 
better.

Warm Regards,

Erik H. Kirk
